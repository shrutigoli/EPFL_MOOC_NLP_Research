1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,078
Among the applications of
operational amplifiers,

2
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,500
there's a fairly well-known one:

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,230
they have no input voltage,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,098
just an output voltage.

5
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:18,408
Sometimes we have to
design a time basis,

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,200
in other words, we have to create a
wave, typically a square wave,

7
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,274
which has a well-established frequency.

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,444
Sometimes, we need
a triangle wave.

9
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,814
We can push to
have a sinusoidal voltage,

10
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:30,361
called an oscillator.

11
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,351
So these kinds of functions carried out

12
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,552
by operational amplifiers,

13
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,957
of course we'll consider
comparators as well,

14
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:41,801
allow for a variety of applications
where there is no input,

15
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,127
but where there is an output.

16
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,551
This output is
a deterministic voltage

17
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:48,306
called a function
generator.

18
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:49,767
These are the sorts of devices

19
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,024
which can be found
on laboratory benches,

20
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,710
and which generate a square wave
with a variable duty cycle,

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,201
or with a variable frequency
generating a variable amplitude.

22
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:03,286
The same goes for a triangle wave,
and for a sinusoidal voltage.

23
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,964
I'm now going to immediately

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,234
introduce these
kinds of functions,

25
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,031
just to show
how we synthesise them

26
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,095
and how we create them

27
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:15,464
with operational amplifiers
and comparators.

28
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,440
We need a time base.

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,640
And so, we need certain parameters

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,454
which help us to
create a certain time

31
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:24,424
that we can control.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,160
The most important aspect of these time bases,
but one not addressed in this chapter,

33
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,237
is quartz.

34
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:32,721
We can use quartz
which can be added

35
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,525
and which would help
to stabilise a frequency.

36
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,664
Here, I'm predominantly going to use
an <i>RSC</i> time constant

37
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:41,178
which, within
the Time domain,

38
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:43,598
and knowing the \tau = RC
time constant,

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,480
would help us to generate simple functions

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,390
which are very easy to wire
in a laboratory and are easy to check.

41
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,299
Before starting to talk
directly about the electronic diagrams,

42
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,602
I would like to remind you

43
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:56,531
of how we deal with
these resistances and capacitances

44
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,768
to create a \tau = RC
time constant.

45
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,713
And just to remind you what this
\tau time constant is,

46
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,637
if you take a
resistance and a capacitance,

47
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:10,638
and if you generate a voltage here,
a Dirac impulsion,

48
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,352
would later become a square wave.

49
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,636
Whenever there's a voltage jump,

50
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:21,319
this circuit will not
react immediately.

51
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,536
Instead, it will move towards the maximum
value of the U0 voltage

52
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:28,243
that we applied to the input.

53
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:31,469
There would be no sudden change
in the input voltage.

54
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,834
An exponential function would be generated.

55
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,773
The objective, just as a reminder,

56
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:38,934
is not to go into the details
about how we found these relationships,

57
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,724
you will have no doubt studied
them in lessons on physics,

58
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,274
basic electronics, or
basic electro-technology.

59
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:47,536
There's a general form here

60
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:51,723
which will always help us to
write the exponential voltage.

61
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,016
Wherever we start from...

62
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,507
We create a voltage jump
from a given value:

63
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,480
here I've given two examples.

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,086
One example is where we start from a
U0 value at the moment equal to 0.

65
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:10,099
Here, we start from a value of 0,
and we make a jump, which is in red,

66
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:14,999
and in blue, we can see that we're
going to end up with the V1 voltage at the output.

67
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,621
Therefore, the V1 voltage would be written

68
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:22,681
as V1 voltage
at time t = 0,

69
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,697
like this.

70
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:28,175
In this instance, t = 0,
and in this curve, it's equal to zero.

71
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,029
V1 starts from zero

72
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,226
and V1 ad infinitem will move

73
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:36,616
towards the maximum value
of the input voltage,

74
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:38,011
namely U0.

75
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:38,752
Why?

76
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,128
Because this capacity will create a charge

77
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,374
and it will be charged by the value.

78
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:48,348
It will reach the value of the
maximum voltage found here.

79
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:51,494
When the U0 is here,
appearing from the other side,

80
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:54,528
well, the resistance R stops
the current from passing,

81
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,453
because there's a difference
in potential equal to zero.

82
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:02,588
By writing this relationship
V1(t = 0) = 0

83
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:07,196
V1( t= ∞), we get the U0 voltage.

84
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:13,307
And here again, we have zero,
multiplied by 1 - e, to the power of -t/RC,

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,980
and we end up with that relationship.

86
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,250
We can do the same with this.

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,866
So, I'd like to find this,

88
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,372
and I say that when t = 0, I start from U0.

89
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,956
So I write U0 here.

90
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:29,965
Eventually, I should find this
voltage, which will move towards zero.

91
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,324
So I would put zero here.

92
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:36,306
And here, when t = 0 = 0,
I get this,

93
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:40,705
and I would find
V1(t) = U0e to the power of -t/RC.

94
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,103
To say that with this form
that I just showed you there,

95
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:46,543
you can always start
at a specified time

96
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,042
that you declare as t = 0, and

97
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,180
you either carry on
or write down this relationship.

98
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,483
That would give you the
analytical expression of the exponential

99
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:58,577
that we would have seen at the output,
when applying a Dirac jump

100
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:01,808
and, later on, there will be a square voltage.

101
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,226
I'd like to show you
a typical example

102
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,001
of a stable switch.

103
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,649
In other words, the V2 voltage

104
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:15,705
will become established
when you connect this circuit here.

105
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,720
And this V2 voltage will be
a square wave.

106
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,661
Really square.

107
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,194
A 50% duty cycle.

108
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:27,955
A 50% duty cycle
is this half period

109
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:30,908
that you can see from here to here.

110
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,795
That really is the half period

111
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,731
because the period that we find here

112
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:36,731
is the complete period.

113
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,554
The half period ends up being t/2.

114
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:44,207
So, we call that a duty
which is equal to 50%

115
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:48,299
and we will ignore
whatever happens at the beginning

116
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,166
when we start this kind of circuit.

117
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,355
So how would this
type of circuit start?

118
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:54,409
For this kind of circuit,
you take an amplifier

119
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,790
which is used as a comparator.

120
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,273
Here, there will be
some sort of comparator

121
00:05:58,273 --> 00:05:59,968
with a positive reaction.

122
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:03,017
I refer you back to the
lesson on hysterisis switches

123
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,813
to recognise this kind of connection.

124
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:08,245
You get a positive reaction,

125
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:10,826
so we return with a component

126
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,966
of the output voltage
on the positive band.

127
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,574
We can compare this node

128
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:21,294
to the V1 node generated by an RC circuit,

129
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,433
such as the one we have just seen.

130
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:26,311
So, this RC circuit
that we saw earlier

131
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,873
has a V1 voltage
which is exponential.

132
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:31,507
Let's say you connect this circuit,

133
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,180
and power the whole circuit,

134
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,701
and let's say that the capacity
was fully discharged,

135
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,631
there would be no charge on the capacity.

136
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,382
If the capacity is discharged,
V1 will start from zero.

137
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,785
And this V1 will move
towards a saturation voltage,

138
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,823
because the V2 voltage,
in a hysterisis comparator,

139
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:51,820
will either be Vsat+ or Vsat-.

140
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,974
And this V1 voltage

141
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,124
on the negative terminal
of this comparator

142
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:00,330
will cause it to trip.

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,904
So this voltage which starts from zero

144
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:06,432
will go in search
of the Vsat voltage,

145
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:12,929
but as soon as it reaches the VT1 value,
which is the trip threshold,

146
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,683
your comparator will change state.

147
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:20,542
So the V2 voltage is an inverter

148
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:23,253
and a comparator with
a hysterisis inverter.

149
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,745
In other words, when the voltage reaches VT1,

150
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:30,166
it will switch from a
positive saturation voltage

151
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,629
to a negative saturation voltage.

152
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,327
So now, V2 will switch

153
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:41,323
from Vsat+

154
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:44,733
to Vsat-.

155
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:47,796
So when this
Vsat- voltage appears,

156
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:51,117
the capacity will discharge
through the resistance.

157
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,113
We will end up
with this exponential,

158
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:58,142
and this exponential will
theoretically continue here

159
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,202
until Vsat-.

160
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,820
It will always look for
the value found here.

161
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,822
We said V2 is equal to Vsat-,

162
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:09,078
so the capacity will discharge itself

163
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:10,750
and we will be left with V1

164
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,803
which will keep on decreasing
until we're left with V2 again.

165
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,241
This will...
sorry,

166
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:18,793
the V1 voltage, which we'll
be left with is equal to Vsat-.

167
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
But that's where we have to stop it.

168
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,450
Why?

169
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:24,005
Because we're in the middle of
intercepting the same voltage

170
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,377
and we will change the Vsat state.

171
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,850
Instead of Vsat-, we will
take it back to Vsat+.

172
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,572
So, when this V1 voltage
is dropping,

173
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,865
we will read its value upon the
input of our comparator

174
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,585
which will then switch again.

175
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,090
So that's it, we go back

176
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,829
and we reverse the charge cycle

177
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,099
which will start around Vsat+.

178
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:52,500
These periodic changes
of voltage will generate

179
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,405
a square wave,

180
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,343
and it's a square wave

181
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:57,613
which is characteristic
of a stable switch

182
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,145
which could generate
a time base

183
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,806
with a given frequency,

184
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,243
Now we will see how this
frequency is calculated.

185
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,369
So, it's a square wave generator

186
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:13,467
and the frequency depends
on R1, R2 and RC values.

187
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,768
To analyse this kind of circuit,

188
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:23,513
we'll take the relationship
that we've just seen,

189
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:27,732
this famous relationship typical
of an RC circuit,

190
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,452
and I'm going to begin from this point here.

191
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,715
I will not take into account
the transient response.

192
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,131
This is the first time,

193
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:39,133
but once we have
generated this impulsion,

194
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,574
we will always start between VT1 and VT2.

195
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:46,025
So, there's the exponential
which will always be stuck by VT1 and VT2

196
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,178
and we'll be left with V2

197
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:52,087
which will always be generated by the charge
and the discharge of these RC circuits.

198
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,345
So, you can see that there's no input,

199
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,232
there are only power supplies.

200
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,740
You're going to assemble this circuit

201
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,968
and straightaway at the input
you'll see a voltage which will establish itself

202
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,552
and which has a square function.

203
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:05,007
So, it's a circuit
which doesn't have an input,

204
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,504
it only has an output.

205
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,735
I'm going to write
the voltage V1(t) starting from here.

206
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:16,383
I start from VT1, and I need to go towards Vsat-.

207
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:21,620
So, when t = 0, I start from VT1.

208
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,300
When t is equal ad infinitem,
I'm going to go towards Vsat

209
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,451
which is negative
because it's -Vsat.

210
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,215
Again, when t = 0,
I have VT1

211
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,325
which I'm going to multiply by this,
what I've written here.

212
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,966
VT1 between brackets -Vsat,

213
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,814
the voltage -VT1 --
because I have a minus sign here --

214
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:50,821
multiplied by --
because I started at this point --

215
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:54,604
I noted 1-e,
to the power of -t/t0,

216
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,645
divided by RC.

217
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,287
With t0 + t/2,

218
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,714
I'm interested in what
is going to happen, just here.

219
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,666
So, I take here to here,

220
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,954
from here to here, and I have half of the period.

221
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,547
So, I'd like to watch
what happens

222
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:23,797
to the V1 voltage when t = t0,
the initial time

223
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,878
to which I added
half of the period.

224
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:29,031
I replace it with this relationship.

225
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,036
I replace t with t0 + t/2,

226
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:35,216
and I'm going to be left with this
relationship that you can see here.

227
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,790
So I get this relationship,

228
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,796
and what I'm interested in is the time T,
or the period.

229
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:46,263
I remind you that the frequency
is the inverse of the period,

230
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:50,004
so if you give me the period,
I can get you the frequency

231
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,928
and, with this expression,
I can calculate the time T

232
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:57,521
which is equal to 2RC
logarithm 1+ 2R1/R2.

233
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,027
To calculate the
dimensions of this kind of circuit,

234
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:05,862
I only have to set a value of R2,
for example,

235
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:10,171
a value of R and a value of R1,

236
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:15,241
and find value C for which
I have the period that I'm looking to calculate,

237
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,577
or the frequency that I'm looking to calculate.

238
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:22,455
And here's a typical example
of a square sign generator.

239
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:25,066
You put a diode in the output,

240
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,889
you rectify this signal,

241
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,757
you establish a rectifying amplifier,

242
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,574
and you're going to find
that the positive or negative component

243
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,786
--it depends
on what you want to do with it,

244
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,208
but you have a signal
in the time base --

245
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,940
depends on a /tau RC time constant.

246
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,286
You set one of the values

247
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:41,363
and then you find the other.

248
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,663
Of course this type of calculation
requires knowledge

249
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,357
because there are standardised values

250
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:49,630
that we must choose in the ranges
that we find in the market.

251
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,811
Take the same circuit,

252
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,309
you can add
in place of an RC resistance --

253
00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:02,578
so I remind you, earlier, that
there was a resistor and a capacitor.

254
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:06,167
Here, I added
two resistors and two diodes.

255
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:12,144
I created a path for the charge
in the direction of the capacity.

256
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:16,506
And there's a path for the discharge
of the capacity in this direction.

257
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,744
So, I charge through RC,
and I discharge through R'C.

258
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,306
Why?

259
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,510
Because this diode,
set in this direction, lets

260
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,694
the current pass through
in only this direction here.

261
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,084
This diode, set in this direction, lets

262
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:32,126
the current pass
through in the other direction.

263
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:35,426
Therefore, I can form a circuit
which has two-time constants:

264
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:38,764
an RC time constant,
and an R'C time constant,

265
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:42,841
which breaks the 50% duty cycle.

266
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:48,106
And now we'll talk about a switch
with an asymmetric output.

267
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:51,049
We don't have
a 50% duty cycle.

268
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,927
Half of the period is divided

269
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:57,983
by one part,
and a second part

270
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:02,555
where the charge and the discharge don't have
the same time constant.

271
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:05,827
Once it was RC, another time it was R'C.

272
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,373
It's another variant to
help generate a V2 voltage

273
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,145
which is not a square signal.

274
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:16,818
It's a signal in the duty cycle,
which is different to 50%.

275
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:21,798
To finalise, we're going to analyse a square
and a triangle signal generator.

276
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:26,820
They are made of two
operational amplifier circuits:

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,226
one circuit with a positive reaction,

278
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,118
the other with a
negative reaction.

279
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:42,886
This circuit with the positive reaction
is a circuit which makes a VT1 and VT2

280
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,453
threshold voltage.

281
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,319
It's the famous comparator with hysterisis

282
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,523
and an integrator which is going to create
a square signal and integrate it.

283
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,595
With that, we will see a square signal generated

284
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,376
on a V2 voltage

285
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:04,154
and a triangle signal,

286
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,547
which is the integral
of this voltage squared,

287
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:11,586
which had been injected inside
this integrator circuit.

288
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,647
So, we integrate the square,
and it gives us a triangle.

289
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,568
To recap,
the output voltage of an integrator

290
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,647
is 1/RC with a minus sign.

291
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:26,342
The integral of the voltage is
nothing other than a square voltage.

292
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:30,141
So we will get the
same frequency for both.

293
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:34,096
On the one hand, it's a square signal,
and on the other a triangle signal.

294
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,799
The comparator hysterisis
has a Δ VT.

295
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,222
We already studied this.

296
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:43,374
I refer you to the part
where we analysed this type of circuit.

297
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,808
You're going to see that this circuit
has two threshold voltages:

298
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,341
VT and -VT.

299
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:53,293
These two threshold voltages,
in this example here, are centred

300
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,408
around zero.

301
00:15:55,468 --> 00:16:00,376
The Δ VT  = 2Vsat R1/R2.

302
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,391
You can have a look at this chapter

303
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:05,072
and remind yourself about this subject.

304
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,703
Let's take this V2 voltage

305
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,216
which only has two values.

306
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:14,034
The V2 voltage will have +Vsat and -Vsat.

307
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:19,925
When it has Vsat+, it can be
integrated between zero and T/2.

308
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:24,296
So, if we take this voltage here
and put it in our integrator,

309
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:26,844
it will be integrated with a minus sign.

310
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,578
This integration with a minus sign

311
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,204
will give us
a negative slope like that.

312
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:37,812
And we'll stick it between a
VT and -VT threshold voltage,

313
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,151
because we'll take the V3 voltage

314
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,304
and return it to the input
of this comparator.

315
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:46,968
In other words, when this voltage
touches the switch voltage

316
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:48,113
of this comparator,

317
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,116
this comparator
immediately changes state.

318
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:55,271
It either goes from -Vsat to +Vsat
or from +Vsat to -Vsat.

319
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,105
And the integrator is always
stuck on these VT voltages.

320
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:03,430
So there's a time trip
equal to T/2.

321
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,730
If we look from here to here,
we can see half of the period

322
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,675
because the period goes from here to here.

323
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:12,916
So, it's best to write
the relationship of the integrator

324
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:17,135
which will integrate by starting either here
or here, whatever you prefer.

325
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,288
Here, I start from a -Vsat voltage,
and so I end up here.

326
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:23,049
I replace V2 by -Vsat.

327
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,637
I integrate between 0 and T/2.

328
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,314
Therefore, I integrate between 0 and T/2

329
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,657
in the relationship of this integrator,

330
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:35,522
and I'll discover that
it's Vsat, divided by RC,

331
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,651
and multiplied by T/2.

332
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:43,678
The time needed to
go from here to here corresponds

333
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:44,680
to this Δ VT,

334
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,551
because I start with +VT minus -VT,

335
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,094
which gives me Δ VT.

336
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:53,393
Therefore, the time needed for
this integrator to pass through

337
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:54,372
half of the period,

338
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,677
which is what I've just done here,

339
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:58,524
is equal to this 2Vsat R1/R2 relationship.

340
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,962
This helps me to
extract the frequency of this circuit,

341
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,880
so I can extract T

342
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,410
according to what I have
just found here.

343
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,307
And that will give me a period
equal to 4RC R1/R2.

344
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,511
Once again, it becomes a circuit
as soon as you give it power.

345
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:20,250
It will begin to generate
a square signal here,

346
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,251
and a triangle signal here,

347
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,040
and you'll have both of these
until you turn the

348
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,333
power supply off.

349
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,825
So, it's something
which has two outputs

350
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:34,301
yet doesn't have an input,
apart from the power supplies.

351
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,577
You can, of course, calculate
the dimensions of these components,

352
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,056
then go and connect them,

353
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:40,366
and watch, and observe.

354
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,614
The circuits which
work very, very well

355
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:46,698
have market
operational amplifiers

356
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,451
and the circuits which have low
power behaviour

357
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,911
have some very very good
amplifier qualities or comparators.

358
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:57,043
Therefore, these signals here
correspond to what we would find

359
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,034
in basic practical exercises

360
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:04,137
and we would definitely find
what I've just explained.

361
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,790
This calculation gives some
extraordinary results

362
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,220
according to the period
that we calculated here.

363
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,730
Good. We've just finished
a number of comparator

364
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,318
applications and of
operational amplifiers,

365
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:20,319
by discussing linear circuits,

366
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,034
non-linear circuits,

367
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,518
and the use of an amplifier
like a signal generator.

368
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,178
We could also observe
or analyse the oscillators.

369
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,402
I think we've mastered

370
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:35,532
the use of an operational
amplifier with this chapter.

371
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,900
We've seen its applications,

372
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,871
and we've managed to
carry out some practical exercises

373
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,083
which demonstrate that some
very well-known market applications

374
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,378
use these operational
amplifiers.

375
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:49,513
There are no secrets for students
when they use these circuits

376
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:51,463
for everyday applications.
