00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:05,736
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:07,795
Today we're going to look at
applications for

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,875
operational amplifiers, or op-amps.

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,858
We've already covered some of them.

5
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:14,664
Today, we're going to look at a whole series.

6
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:17,841
We're going to start with linear applications.

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:22,097
Then we'll go on to look at a series of
non-linear applications.

8
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:25,359
Then we'll finish with an application
that is quite specific

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,029
that requires a signal generation circuit
at the output

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,264
that we call a signal generator.

11
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:34,871
For the first application of an op-amp

12
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,510
in the series of linear applications,

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,902
I'd like to look again at a plan
that we've already studied.

14
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:44,362
It's a plan that we've seen where the
op-amp is in negative feedback.

15
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,398
So we've got the two resistances,

16
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:49,132
with a return from the output to the
negative terminal.

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,925
And a positive input used directly by a signal,

18
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:57,798
we'll call it an op-amp with two inputs with
a negative feedback.

19
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,760
And I'd like to use it for an application

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,531
in which the voltage output <i>Vout</i>

21
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,136
is proportional at the same time to
<i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>,

22
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,206
which is the case in this example.

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,133
But I'd like to find a relationship
that corresponds to a voltage <i>Vout</i>

24
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,137
which is equal to a constant
that multiplies

25
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:19,303
the difference of <i>(V2-V1)</i> or of <i>(V1-V2)</i>.

26
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,135
The plan that is represented here
has already been looked at.

27
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,856
It has an output that depends on
<i>V2</i> and <i>V1</i>.

28
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,561
Remember, we've already covered this,

29
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,849
we applied it to the superposition principle:

30
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,964
we took the voltage <i>V2</i>
and we connected it to the volume.

31
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:42,629
And we saw that by connecting the
voltage <i>V2</i> to the volume

32
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,318
we found that there was a relationship,
or circuit,

33
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:48,430
that is the inverting circuit.

34
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,739
So <i>Vout</i> = <i>V1</i> times <i>R2/R1</i>
with a minus - sign in front, that we find here.

35
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,501
We can take the same plan

36
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,264
but this time connect the
<i>V1</i> to the volume.

37
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:08,999
So I connect this to the volume.

38
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:13,360
And I see that <i>Vout</i> = <i>f(V2)</i>,
and I will find that it's a plan

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,822
of a non-inverting p-amp
that is equal to 1+<i>R2/R1</i>

40
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:21,340
that multiplies <i>V2</i> and sends
it back to the output

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,367
to arrive at a voltage <i>V2</i>
proportional to <i>(R1+R2)/R1</i>.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,650
So, I'll take the same plan
but this time I'll modify it,

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,403
by adding something so that in the end

44
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:40,237
instead of having <i>(R1+R2)/R1</i> and <i>R2/R1</i>,

45
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:44,634
each constant multiplies the variable <i>V2</i>
and the variable <i>V1</i>.

46
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:48,569
I'd like to reduce it to a
constant that multiplies the difference.

47
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,439
By looking here, we notice something simple.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,384
If I come here,

49
00:02:54,933 --> 00:03:06,196
I multiply this
by <i>R2/(R1+R2)</i>,

50
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:10,150
and I'll be able to simplify it to <i>R1+R2</i>

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,223
and I find <i>R2/R1</i> which multiplies <i>V2</i>
and <i>R2/R1</i> which multiplies <i>V1</i>.

52
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:22,660
and now I've got <i>Vout</i> = <i>R2/R1</i>
that corresponds to this <i>A(D)</i> which is here,

53
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:25,432
and that multiplies
the difference between the voltages <i>V2-V1</i>.

54
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:31,474
The advantage of such a circuit is that I've
a voltage <i>V1</i> in relation to <i>V2</i>

55
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:32,861
and <i>V2</i> in relation to <i>V1</i>,

56
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,334
that gives me a floating voltage
with a common-mode at the input,

57
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,872
so it's the difference
between these two voltages.

58
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:40,460
It's very useful

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,866
compared to the two circuits that we looked
at before.

60
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:46,854
Each time that we had an input,
and the input was in relationship to the volume.

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,728
Here, I can't see where the volume is,
I see a common-mode,

62
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,835
and this common-mode
is the voltage at the terminals from which

63
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:57,036
I will be able to pivot <i>V1</i>
in relation to <i>V2</i>.

64
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,768
And we call it an op-amp,

65
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:05,865
with a voltage proportional
to the difference in the voltages <i>V2-V1</i>,

66
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:08,101
therefore : differential amplifier.

67
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:10,065
Here's the cell to add.

68
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:13,325

You will have soon realised that to
find a voltage

69
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:17,362
that is multiplied by <i>R2/(R1+R2)</i>,

70
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:22,604
it corresponds to adding a divisive
resistance <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>,

71
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:26,295
and the voltage achieved at the output

72
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:30,056
will be the voltage at the input <i>V2</i>
that is multiplied by this constant,

73
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:33,622
on the condition that there was no current
at all coming from this node here,

74
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:34,425
which is the case.

75
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:38,131
Because the current that we see here,
is a current <i>i</i> = 0

76
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:44,934
so there's no chance that I falsify the value of
<i>V'2</i> in relation to <i>V2</i>,

77
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,712
and that is simply <i>R2/(R1+R2)</i>.

78
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:52,395
And there you have it, our circuit is called
a differential amplifier

79
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,801
that will apply a voltage <i>V1</i>
in relation to <i>V2</i>

80
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:59,559
and multiply it by the constant that
we're now going to calculate

81
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:04,200
that will be <i>Vout</i>
proportional to this.

82
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,899
The same explanation, but this time in
relation to the amplifier

83
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:17,074
with its voltage <i>V1</i>
but this time on the positive terminal,

84
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:21,971
the voltage that we've got is <i>V'2</i>.

85
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:27,931
And I replace <i>V'2</i>
that multiplies the <i>(R1+R2)/R1 - V1</i>R2/R1*,

86
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:30,090
that we've just looked at.

87
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,029
We just need to replace <i>V'2</i>
by its value.

88
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:40,240
So the <i>V'2</i> will become <i>V2R2/(R1+R2)</i>.

89
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,336
Once I've replaced the <i>V'2</i>
with this value here,

90
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:49,464
so it's the <i>V'2</i> that's here,

91
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,403
I replace it with its value,

92
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:58,898
and voila, I can simplify it by <i>R1+R2</i>

93
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:04,138
and I get <i>V2</i> times <i>R2/R1</i>
minus <i>V1</i> times <i>R2/R1</i>

94
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:07,224
so now I can put <i>R2/R1</i> in evidence

95
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:10,706
and I can find <i>V2-V1</i>
which multiplies a constant.

96
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:15,702
There you go, I've found that <i> A(D)</i>
is equal to <i>R2/R1</i>.

97
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:19,816
To summarise, we've got something
that looks like this.

98
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,525
So, we've found the output voltage

99
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,334
proportional to the difference between
the input voltage.

100
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,984
For sure, there isn't a negative or
positive voltage.

101
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,579
You just have to inverse <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>
or <i>V2</i> and <i>V1</i>

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,802
and the output <i>Vout</i> will change phase

103
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:38,427
in function to the nature of the voltages
that we've put at the input <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>.

104
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,095
I just need to mention one more thing
about this circuit.

105
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:47,131
A current will pass through here and
a current will pass through there.

106
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:51,404
We can see that there's an impedance <i>R1</i>
on this track here.

107
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:54,164
The voltage <i>A</i> and <i>A</i> is the same,

108
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,068
So with an infinite gain, the amplifier
will equalise this node here and this node here.

109
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:03,198
And we've got a differential amplifier
with an input resistance

110
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,706
equal to twice this resistance <i>R1</i>.

111
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,663
So, we've got a current
that will be debited by the source.

112
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:13,033
It's not an infinite input,
it's a finite input

113
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,703
that is falsified or impacted
by the value of the resistance <i>R1</i>

114
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,760
that we've chosen to put here.

115
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:23,024
And yes, we're going to solve this problem
of impedance at the input

116
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:26,283
of a differential amplifier.

117
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:31,054
We would like one of the voltages to
have an infinite input impedance,

118
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,861
meaning no current here, <i>i</i> = 0.

119
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,165
And the same for the voltage source <i>V2</i>,

120
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,558
we're going to do something so as to not
take any current

121
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:42,393
from the source that happened before.

122
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:46,636
We've chosen this circuit, it's a well-known
but not well-used circuit.

123
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,537
I'll tell you why it's not very well-used later on.

124
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,011
However, there is this characteristic of
being very didactic.

125
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:58,123
It allows us to see that when we take
a non-inverting amplifier

126
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,364
such as this one,

127
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:04,876
we see that the voltage that
we have at the output <i>V'2</i>

128
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:07,996
in function to the voltage that we
have at the input, which is <i>V1</i>.

129
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,765
Which is what is written down here.

130
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,035
The voltage <i>V'2</i> is nothing other than

131
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:15,096
the voltage <i>V1</i> multiplied
by the gain of this amplifier

132
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,467
which is 1+<i>R1/R2</i>,

133
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,696
and there it is.

134
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:24,613
We take this voltage
and we apply it to the op-amp's input

135
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:28,233
where we're going to use both inputs
<i>V2</i> and <i>V'2</i>.

136
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:34,532
So, the second op-amp which is here
will take the voltage <i>V'2</i> which is here

137
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:37,169
as well as the voltage <i>V2</i>

138
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,377
and it will behave as does this type of
op-amp with two inputs,

139
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:44,331
it will give us a voltage output <i>Vout</i>

140
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:48,932
proportional to the voltage <i>V2</i>, which is here,
multiplied by the gain.

141
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:52,533
So as usual, we've applied
the superposition principle,

142
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:57,296
we cancel <i>V'2</i> and then we will cancel <i>V2</i>
and we'll have an inverting amplifier

143
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:01,502
that will give us <i>V'2</i> times <i>R2/R1</i>.

144
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:06,091
And <i>V'2</i>, in effect,
is the voltage that we've got here.

145
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:13,072
So the <i>V'2</i> connected here
will be multiplied by <i>R2/R1</i>.

146
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:18,603
And <i>V'2</i> being proportional to <i>V1</i>,
you just have to replace this with this,

147
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:22,426
and you see,
you can simplify by <i>R2</i>

148
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:26,464
and you find the expression that we've
been looking for,

149
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:29,138
this one here.

150
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:33,843
Here's the solution that we're looking for,

151
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:36,833
it's a solution in which we've got
a constant.

152
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:42,260
This constant is proportional to a
differential gain

153
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,419
because it will multiply <i>V2-V1</i>.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,096
And, exactly what we're looking for, it's a
difference of voltage,

155
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:53,542
one referenced to the other, so it's floating,

156
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,668
multiplied by a differential constant,

157
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:59,745
that we'll determine in function to
the two resistances <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>.

158
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,333
But the most interesting thing about this
example is that <i>Rin</i>,

159
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,337
in this case, is infinite.

160
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,994
Why don't we use this circuit very often?

161
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:14,889
This circuit isn't very easy to apply

162
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:19,630
to silicon, because very often we prefer
to use symmetrical circuits,

163
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,765
where we've got the same components,

164
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:25,774
where geometrically, by implementing them onto
the microchip we've got a symmetrical axis,

165
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,615
which isn't the case here.

166
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:30,426
We've got two op-amps following
each other,

167
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,857
and two resistances.

168
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,341
This resistance is equal
to this one,

169
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,099
but they are swapped around, they aren't in
the same place:

170
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:39,237
the resistance <i>R2</i>
gives a negative feedback here.

171
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:41,406
However, there, it's the resistance <i>R1</i>.

172
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:44,545
So, it's a circuit that gives us matching problems.

173
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:47,212
Later on, if you do microelectronics

174
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,298
you'll understand
what I mean in terms of matching,

175
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,569
because the variability of components

176
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,671
is absorbed by the
relative value of these components.

177
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,287
The circuit that we see
here is extremely important

178
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,467
with regards to what we've just seen,

179
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,638
because of a very interesting characteristic:

180
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:10,500
the ease in which it can be implemented
onto silicon

181
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,649
and to keep a symmetrical axis

182
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,938
by using similar structures.

183
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:21,809
Watch, if we pass a symmetrical axis through here,

184
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,768
you'll see that if we do an abstraction
of the resistance <i>R4</i>,

185
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:29,161
that <i>R3</i> is repeated twice,
and the same for <i>R1</i>, <i>R2</i>,

186
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:33,686
an op-amp here,
the same op-amp repeated twice over,

187
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,837
and this one is added at the end

188
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,507
which has the possibility
to add a symmetrical axis inside.

189
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:41,004
Why do we insist on this notion of symmetry?

190
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:45,293
Because it's a structure that once
implemented onto silicon,

191
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,951
allows us to create a circuit where absolute
error absorption

192
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,353
is compensated for by relative errors.

193
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,125
We call them matching errors because we
can't match

194
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,626
the resistances much more when we've
got a relative value,

195
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:05,695
so the same resistance <i>R3</i>
repeated twice,

196
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,267
even if the absolute value <i>R3</i>
is an error,

197
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:12,070
the resistance <i>R3</i> is similar
on both sides

198
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:19,770
thanks to the fact that it
has all been symmetrically repeated twice.

199
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:24,954
This helps us to improve the quality of
the amplifier,

200
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,728
it allows us to achieve a structure

201
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:30,999
that is guaranteed in common-mode

202
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:33,763
that will be cancelled by the same
structure of the amplifier.

203
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:39,657
And we find it on the market as instrumentation
amplifiers,

204
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:43,636
it can also be found as a pre-amplifier for
a microphone.

205
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:47,505
It's also a structure that is sold

206
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:53,790
in the form of an integrated amplifier
with external pins on the chip

207
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,605
and an external feed.

208
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,358
So, we're going to study this structure,

209
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:02,301
that is widely
used for applications with captors.

210
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,991
To start with, I going to make it simpler,

211
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:09,407
just to show what happens if there isn't any
resistance <i>R4</i>.

212
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:15,338
Suppose that I take away this resistance here,

213
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:21,069
I remove it from my plan and we see what
happens to the circuit

214
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,093
once the resistance <i>R4</i> exists no longer.

215
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,733
If you look at the structure here,

216
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:31,958
which is similar to this one,
it's a voltage tracker.

217
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,963
So the voltage <i>V1</i>,
even when the resistance <i>R3</i> is there,

218
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:39,367
is copied over to <i>A</i>.

219
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,613
in any case,
the current passing through here is nil,

220
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:46,866
the same on the other side.

221
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:52,721
So <i>R3</i> doesn't react at all
on the signal <i>V1</i> and copied onto the node <i>A</i>.

222
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,703
There isn't any current
passing through here,

223
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:58,796
so <i>V1</i>= <i>V(A)</i> and <i>V(A)</i> = <i>V(C)</i>.

224
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:03,337
So we find <i> V1 </i> that appears here.
And that, it acts as a buffer,

225
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:05,233
like a plug,

226
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,791
that allows the input impedance to
be rendered infinitive,

227
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,104
no current.

228
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,658
The same on the other side.

229
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:14,952
So the voltage <i>V1</i>,
or the source that is connected here <i>V1</i>,

230
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,390
and that that is connected to <i>V2</i>
or the source that is between <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>

231
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,498
should not supply any current at all to this
type of circuit,

232
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:25,198
and we will recognise it as our differential
amplifier

233
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,967
that we saw at the beginning of this lecture,

234
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,702
this amplifier that takes the difference in
voltage and multiplies it by a gain,

235
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,900
and this gain is returned to the output.

236
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:38,574
I'm going to take the same circuit,

237
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:42,699
and I'm going to add the resistance <i>R4</i>
that can be external.

238
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,368
Some manufacturers sell it with
this resistance <i>R4</i>

239
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,548
on the outside to allow a gain

240
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,064
on the input stages.

241
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,750
Here, we've simply made an input stage
without a gain,

242
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,743
so the resistance <i>R3</i> is here and <i>R3</i> here,

243
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,435
we didn't have to use it,
it's not doing anything here.

244
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,863
Let's suppose now that we take the same circuit,

245
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,436
here it is, the same circuit,
but this time with the resistance <i>R4</i>.

246
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:10,197
The voltage <i>V2</i> is equal to the voltage <i>V(B)</i>.

247
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,438
The voltage <i>V1</i> is equal to the voltage <i>V(A)</i>.

248
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:23,539
And we've got an output <i>C</i> and an output <i>D</i>
that depends on <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>.

249
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,401
It goes without saying
that when we've got a negative feedback

250
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,259
we always apply the superposition principle.

251
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:37,138
I think that everyone knows that we start by
saying <i>V2</i> = <i>V(B)</i>,

252
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:39,783
so as if I had the voltage <i>V2</i> here.

253
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:44,158
And if I analyse the amp that is here,

254
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:49,430
I will recognise that it's an amplifier
with two inputs,

255
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,138
like the one we saw at the beginning of the course.

256
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:54,699
It's got a voltage <i>V1</i>
and a voltage <i>V2</i>,

257
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:58,893
and we just have to write down the relationship
<i>V(C)</i> = <i>f(V1,V2)</i>.

258
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,564
We do the same for the second amplifier.

259
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:06,494
We take the second amplifier which is
at the bottom

260
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:08,174
and do the same to that one

261
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:11,166
by saying that <i>V1</i>
is copied over to <i>V(A)</i>

262
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,046
and we would have taken this resistance

263
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:18,309
and this one, and we associate them with
this op-amp

264
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,787
and we'd have expressed <i>V(D)</i> = <i>f(V1,V2)</i>.

265
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,618
So, we're going to express <i>V(C)</i> and <i>V(D)</i>.

266
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,000
Here are the two voltages <i>V(C)</i> and <i>V(D)</i>.

267
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,264
Once we've applied <i>V(C)</i> = <i>f(V1,V2)</i>
as we've just seen,

268
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,895
and the same for <i>V(D)</i>,

269
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,732
we'll find that <i>V(C)</i>
is proportional to <i>V1</i>

270
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:49,468
multiplied by <i>(R3+R4)/R4-V2</i> times <i>R3/R4</i>.

271
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,233
The same for <i>V(D)</i>.

272
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:56,305
And once we've got <i>V(C)</i> and <i>V(D)</i>
we'll take our differential amplifier circuit,

273
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,875
that's here

274
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,820
and apply <i>V(C)</i> and <i>V(D)</i> to it
and use the relationship

275
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,834
that we found earlier on.

276
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:09,028
So, we'll find
<i>Vout</i> = <i>f(V(D),V(C))</i>.

277
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,067
And, given that <i>V(D)</i> and <i>V(C)</i>
will depend on <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>,

278
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:16,375
here's the final relationship that we're
going to find

279
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,705
between <i>Vout</i>, <i>V2</i>, -<i>V1</i>
multiplied by a constant.

280
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:25,031
Remember that the objective is to find
the constant <i>A(D)</i>,

281
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:29,168
it's the differential gain
that multiplies the difference in voltage.

282
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:33,499
This type of application allows someone

283
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,311
to take the voltage <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>,

284
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,797
typically you've got
a voltmeter with two sensors,

285
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:41,729
that you connect onto both terminals
of the voltmeter,

286
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,340
to measure a difference in potential,

287
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,431
and these two differences in potential

288
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,594
are not at all referenced to the volume,

289
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:50,938
they're referenced to something else.

290
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:57,866
At your voltmeter’s input you've got a
circuit like this one

291
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:03,299
and you're going to make work a resistance,
often it's the resistance <i>R4</i>,

292
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,320
that the manufacturer leaves on the outside.

293
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,880
You can modify it in order to change the gain,

294
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,171
because we see the resistance <i>R4</i> here.

295
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:16,029
So, we want to change the gain
while having two floating voltages.

296
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,768
We get an excellent amplification with
this type of application

297
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:23,929
for everything that's done
with Wheatstone bridges.

298
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,748
So it's with these bridges with captors
that measure the differential voltage,

299
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:30,903
and this differential voltage and
is multiplied by a certain gain

300
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,209
and we find it on an integrated circuit.

301
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:37,435
The advantage of this type of application
is that you have a common-mode,

302
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:43,634
meaning that the parasites that arrive
in equal quantities on <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>.

303
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:49,433
It's as if we've got a <i>V1</i> = <i>V2</i>,
as if we've got a short circuit

304
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,746
with <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>,

305
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,455
and we've got a source connected to both of them,

306
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,870
that debits a certain amount of voltage.

307
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,784
So, remember that
we spoke about a common-mode gain.

308
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:06,119
As if <i>V1</i> is copied here
and <i>V2</i> is copied here,

309
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,999
if <i>V1</i> = <i>V2</i>, so <i>V(A)</i> = <i>V(B)</i>

310
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,728
there isn't any current running through
the resistance <i>R4</i>.

311
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:17,766
So we'll find our <i>V1</i> here,
we'll find our <i>V2</i> here.

312
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:21,788
And here, we've got a differential amplifier
that sees <i>V1</i> brought directly to here,

313
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,939
<i>V2</i> brought directly here.

314
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,847
Despite the existence of <i>R4</i>,

315
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,146
if the gain of these two amps are
high enough,

316
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:34,567
then the common-mode is cancelled out
by the fact that there isn't any current

317
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,176
going through the resistance <i>R4</i>.

318
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,198
And the voltage difference here
will be equal to 0,

319
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:42,960
and this voltage here, again, <i>U</i> = 0.

320
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,559
And this amp doesn't
amplify the tension difference

321
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,776
that will be found here,

322
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,197
so it will give us a voltage close to 0

323
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:55,134
and that creates an excellent
"common mode rejection ratio",

324
00:19:55,336 --> 00:20:00,966
or an excellent common-mode gain
in this type of set-up.

325
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:03,879
So, I'm convinced that it's a circuit

326
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:07,465
that is used in linear application in which
we want to

327
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,470
multiply a difference in voltage
by a certain gain,

328
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,743
and we find examples of these in the form
of integrated amplifiers

329
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,824
and it's used by many manufacturers.
