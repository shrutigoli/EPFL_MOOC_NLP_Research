1
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:07,923
Earlier on, we studied this circuit.

2
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,475
We called it a <i>distance sensor</i>,

3
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:15,725
we called it a <i>voltage-current converter </i>;

4
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:21,057
we sent out an optical signal,
we received it onto this diode,

5
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,551
we converted it into current.

6
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:26,744
Here, the photons are converted into current.

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:29,880
The current is transformed into voltage
by this impedance.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,066
The filter added by the resistance <i>R C</i>
has cut off a frequency component.

9
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,230
And here, please take this plan here,

10
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,676
and go into a laboratory and wire it up.

11
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:46,910
And you'll see, the same circuit as
earlier on,

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,139
has been used to detect an object that passes
in front of an optical barrier,

13
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:53,973
if you put your finger here,

14
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:58,231
and your finger receives an optical signal
through it,

15
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:02,022
and the blood flowing through your body will
modulate this light

16
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:04,362
before reaching this diode here,

17
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:09,327
the current that you see here corresponds to
the modulation of the blood flow

18
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,222
in your finger.

19
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,504
And this current here becomes voltage,
through this impendence

20
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,932
and mainly through this resistance.

21
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:22,287
And when this arrives at a filter,

22
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,631
this frequency component will also be removed.

23
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:29,789
So you'll get an output tension <i>v2</i>;

24
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:33,018
this voltage <i>v2</i> is a component

25
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:37,538
in which the input signal was a flux variation...

26
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:41,898
the blood in your veins

27
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,427
converted into current modulations,

28
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:48,138
converted into voltage brought to a tension

29
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:51,228
that you can read on the oscilloscope

30
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:55,718
and you'll see that the beating of your heart
appears on the oscilloscope.

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,349
The transfer functions and the
transresistance that is here,

32
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,020
is this here,

33
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:04,867
we've taken a variable <i>i_s</i>
that is a current

34
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,979
and we've converted into tension
by multiplying it

35
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,651
by this transfer function.

36
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:13,235
This voltage here, <i>v1</i> by multiplying
it by this transfer function,

37
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:14,605
we'll arrive at the voltage <i>v2</i>

38
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:18,095
and it's this voltage that you see on
the oscilloscope.

39
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,495
If you plug this in, you'll be able to get

40
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,260
a kind of signal reading on the oscilloscope

41
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,260
of the heartbeat, as seen by the oscilloscope.

42
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,549
You can put a comparator here

43
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:36,911
which converts the signal that we're going to
look at in a second.

44
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,221
We've got a square wave signal

45
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:42,411
and you put a counter,
do a reset <i>reset</i> of the counter

46
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,787
every minute,

47
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:47,953
and there, you're capable of observing
what your heart rate is per minute.

48
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,769
So, this is a classic application that we

49
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,429
find nowadays in certain wristwatches.

50
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,274
Let's have a look now at the finished
application and

51
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:00,341
at what the oscilloscope is showing us.

52
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,634
We take the same setup as earlier on,

53
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,829
the one that we used as an object sensor,

54
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,095
we'll put back the diode, this time

55
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,460
opposite the other one.

56
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,117
So, our emitting diode is here

57
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,502
and here's the receiver,

58
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:13,968
but we've put them opposite each other

59
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,612
and this time, we'll try

60
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,048
inserting a finger.

61
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,068
The finger has blood vessels running through it,

62
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,538
with blood flowing through them,

63
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:22,766
and the heartbeat will modulate
the light

64
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,770
and that's what we saw earlier on,
on the oscilloscope.

65
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,127
We can see the heartbeat.

66
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,667
I advise that you shield it

67
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,382
while you take your measurements,

68
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:34,369
to protect it from outside light

69
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:36,587
and give you a steadier signal.

70
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,134
And here are the results that you can see
at the output of this type of circuit,

71
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,686
a heartbeat, which has exactly the flicker

72
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:46,407
of a heartbeat that we expect on this type
of equipment;

73
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:51,284
you can see that the beat is quite regular,

74
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,753
and you just have to add a counter.

75
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:56,076
So we can put a simple comparator,

76
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,066
and behind a digital counter

77
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,337
and display the number of beats per minute

78
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,984
to make use of this type of setup.

79
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,869
I'd like to finish off the linear applications

80
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,467
with a voltage-current converter.

81
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,651
We talked about a voltage-current converter,

82
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:17,114
this time, we've got a voltage difference
at the input

83
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:20,226
and we'd like to see a current
at the output

84
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,481
proportional to this voltage difference.

85
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,071
For sure, we're going to use our operational
amplifier,

86
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:30,318
with a resistance <i>R1</i>,
that is used as negative feedback,

87
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:35,058
we've added another resistance <i>R2</i>
and <i>R2</i> twice.

88
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:38,654
Our charge is added to this node here,

89
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,297
so we won't connect to the amp's <i>Vout</i>,

90
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,816
we're going to use the current coming from
here instead,

91
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,816
that is supplied

92
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,358
by the amplifier
through the current <i>i2</i>

93
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,641
with a contribution of <i>i1</i>.

94
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,040
So each time we've got a plan with an
operational amplifier,

95
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,480
and if the amplifier is
in the linear zone,

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,542
we can be sure in saying:

97
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,740
the voltage <i>vB</i> = the voltage <i>vA</i>.

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,047
It's always the case.

99
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:07,487
We can be sure in saying that this current here,
on node B,

100
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,542
the sum of the current on node B = 0

101
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,175
it's linked to Kirchhoff's law,

102
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,999
but in having this current...

103
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,694
<i>i ̄ = 0</i>

104
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,209
and this current <i>i+ = 0</i>

105
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,755
an yes, we can always say:

106
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,067
the sum of the current here is equal to 0

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,180
but without taking into account this current

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
and the same here.

109
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,113
So, I'm going to write down two expressions:

110
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,698
A first one that says:

111
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:37,622
the sum of the current where Node A = 0

112
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:41,235
the sum of the current where Node B = 0

113
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:46,586
and I'm going to use the fact that the
voltage i>vB = the voltage <i>vA</i>.

114
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,392
So, it's a linear application

115
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:54,184
and that the amplifier guarantees
that the voltage <i>V+</i> = voltage <i>V-</i>.

116
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:57,134
Let's start with Node A

117
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:00,116
in writing down that <i>i</i>, this current here,

118
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,584
= <i>i1 + i2</i>.

119
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,261
<i>i1</i>, it's this current,
the input current,

120
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:11,136
<i>i2</i>, it's the current that is
supplied by the <i>Vout</i> at the output.

121
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,979
So I'm going to add <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i>

122
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,916
and bring that to a current <i>i</i>.

123
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,261
I'm writing it down here.

124
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,096
The current <i>i1</i>, it's <i>v1 - vA</i>;

125
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:27,621
the current <i>i2</i>, it's <i>Vout - vA</i>

126
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:29,551
and there we have it.

127
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,041
<i>(v1 - vA) / R2</i> for <i>i1</i>

128
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:37,842
<i>(Vout - vA) / R2</i>

129
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,393
gives me the current <i>i2</i>.

130
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:44,048
I write down these two expressions
and I develop them.

131
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:49,286
If the expression of the current <i>i</i>
in function to <i>v1</i>, <i>Vout</i>

132
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:52,689
and the potential,
or the potential variation,

133
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,685
that I see on Node A.

134
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:57,154
Divide all of it by <i>R₂</i>.

135
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:03,164
The same, I take the Node B and all I have
to say here is

136
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,779
that this current is equal to this current,

137
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:08,296
given that there isn't any current passing
through here.

138
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:13,660
So, the current <i>i' = (v2 - vB) / R1</i>,

139
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,170
what I've written down here.

140
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:20,059
For sure, I can say
<i>(vB - Vout) / R1</i>

141
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,959
giving me again i>i'

142
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,133
because it's the same current that I'm
seeing on both sides.

143
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:28,544
I write down this relationship and I
can draw from here

144
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:31,544
a relationship of <i>Vout</i> in function to <i>vB</i>

145
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,414
because when I look at this node <i>vB</i>

146
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:35,407
but it's the same as this node <i>vA</i>.

147
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:38,569
I can replace <i>vB</i> with <i>vA</i>

148
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,522
and I find the same expression

149
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:43,962
that links <i>Vout</i> to <i>-v2 + 2vA</i>

150
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,974
and I take the <i>2vA</i> here

151
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,974
and I express it in this relationship here

152
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:52,901
that is equal to <i>Vout + v2</i>

153
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,876
because inside here I've got <i>2vA</i>

154
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,336
that I just have to replace with <i>Vout + v2</i>

155
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:00,845
and this relationship <i>i</i> straight
away gives me

156
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,852
a voltage difference <i>(v1 - v2) / R2</i>.

157
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:07,117
So, if you've got a potential difference,

158
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,706
and you'd like to see a
current <i>i</i> proportional

159
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,443
to this potential difference,

160
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:14,339
in relation to a given resistance,

161
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,224
you'll get <i>v1 - v2</i>
over the resistance <i>R2</i>

162
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:23,230
that you can inject into an external
resistance that we call <i>RL</i>,

163
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,168
so the current being drawn from this node here,

164
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,093
you put into a linear relationship,

165
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,983
will be converted by a current

166
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:36,142
added to or injected into a resistance,

167
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,264
but in reality, the current is proportional

168
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,887
to a difference in voltage.

169
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,483
This type of setup can be unstable.

170
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:47,752
Remember that the negative feedback
is established by <i>R1</i> that is here,

171
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:52,374
we had detected a component at the output, on the
positive terminal,

172
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:54,763
that could possibly create instability,

173
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:57,725
yes, it could be that the choice of
resistances here

174
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:59,376
could pose a problem.

175
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,076
This type of setup also suffers from

176
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:05,400
equipment problems that we've talked about.

177
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,712
They seem to be symmetric, we'd like to have

178
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:12,304
<i>R1</i> absolutely equal to <i>R1</i>
and <i>R2</i> absolutely equal to <i>R2</i>

179
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:15,595
knowing that when we take a discrete resistor,

180
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:18,341
we often get a value tolerance,

181
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:22,658
so this could be severely affected by the
resistance values.

182
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:25,290
In an integrated circuit, we can do better,

183
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,546
because we can equip <i>R1</i> with <i>R1</i>
and <i>R2</i> with <i>R2</i>

184
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:31,573
and find values that are, in relative value,

185
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:32,783
quite correct.

186
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,448
So we've just finished a whole series of
linear applications,

187
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,799
with operational amplifiers;

188
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,111
with this, I've finished a whole series that
demonstrates

189
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:45,501
that operational amplifiers with
specific circuits added on

190
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,269
can take a voltage,
multiply it by a constant,

191
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,998
and convert it into output voltage

192
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:55,154
all while keeping within
the linear zone of the amp

193
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:58,821
and all in keeping a linear relationship
between the input and the output.

194
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:02,383
We've also seen that we
an do the same with a current

195
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,424
by converting it into a voltage,

196
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,572
and we've seen that
we can do the same with a voltage,

197
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,530
or a voltage difference,

198
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,253
by converting it to a current at the output.

199
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:11,793
There are lots of applications

200
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,379
in the linear world of the amplifier

201
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,579
but I now think that,

202
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,579
a student that has
followed this course

203
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,241
along with the previous lessons

204
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,707
will always be able to analyse the circuits
inside an operational amplifier

205
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,374
when the amplifier hasn't been saturated,

206
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,174
meaning when the amplifier stays within

207
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:27,652
the linear zone.

208
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:31,286
We've understood that superposition works
very well indeed,

209
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,720
and that we can cancel out the voltage
between the + and the - of the amp

210
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,496
when the gain is very high,

211
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:40,319
and when there isn't any current entering
the positive and negative terminals

212
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,589
and that at the output, we can supply
large amounts of current.

213
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,397
With that, we've come to the end of the
operational amplifier

214
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,774
with a series of examples
coming from the linear world.

215
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:55,515
Now we're going to look at the non-linear world.
