1
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:07,439
A second linear application will be
an application

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,299
based on something that we've
already seen,

3
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:13,029
it's how to convert a current
and a voltage.

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,075
The question seems to be simple

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:20,015
because we say that current and voltage
are governed by the law of Ohm,

6
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:23,755
voltage is linked to a current
by multiplying by a resistance.

7
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:29,745
So you just need to take a current <i>IS</i>
and inject it into a resistance

8
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:33,745
and this current <i>IS</i> will generate
a voltage <i>v2</i>

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:37,365
that is proportional to the resistance
multiplied by the current

10
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,585
that we would like to see.

11
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:41,035
So we've got a linear relationship
between <i>v2</i> and <i>IS</i>.

12
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,729
This is valid if our source is ideal.

13
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,209
However, if by chance our source suffers
from a resistance parasite,

14
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,859
that is placed in parallel

15
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,209
and that makes up the structure
of the source,

16
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:55,639
we can't take it away,

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,779
it's internal to the source,
it's a parasite.

18
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:03,299
And yes, your current <i>IS</i> is here.

19
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,809
For this current, all depends on the
voltage <i>v2</i>

20
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,339
that you've got at the output.

21
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:12,356
On this side here,
the voltage <i>v2</i> is linked to <i>R</i>.

22
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,596
On this side here, the voltage <i>v2</i>,

23
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,046
once it has been established,

24
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:19,656
will have <i>v2</i>
at the resistance terminals <i>RS</i>

25
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:22,496
and <i>v2</i> at the resistance terminals <i>R</i>

26
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,996
and you'll have a current passing
through here.

27
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:31,226
We're going to call it a current <i>i'S</i>
that is equal to <i>v2/RS</i>.

28
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:37,306
But this is a parasite current,
that will be taken away from this current <i>IS</i>

29
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,366
and sent back to your charge.

30
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,606
So this current passing through your charge,

31
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:46,926
is absolutely not <i>IS</i>,
it's a current <i>IS</i> that is <i>-i'S</i>.

32
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:50,708
So it won't be a direct reading of the
variation in current.

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,668
You'll get a voltage <i>v2</i>
that will be directly proportional

34
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:58,668
to the fact that there is internal
resistance to the source

35
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,288
and an external resistance.

36
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,788
For sure, you're going to tell me that
if this resistance

37
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,668
is much bigger than this one here,

38
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,708
we won't see any effect, which is true.

39
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,238
Sometimes it happens that current sources

40
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:13,268
have resistances so big in relation to
the charge resistance,

41
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:15,808
so as to have a minimum current passing
through here.

42
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:19,196
But to eradicate this type of problem

43
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:23,666
and to be able to use the current that we
draw from a current source

44
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,736
completely debited,
it is converted to a voltage.

45
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,376
Remember from the introductory course

46
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,966
on this type of circuit analysis,

47
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,426
we said that if you want to read a current,

48
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:35,436
you should read it in a short circuit,

49
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:40,462
meaning that we said to short-circuit a voltage

50
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:43,112
or apply a voltage equal to zero.

51
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,162
At this present moment,
any resistance

52
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:48,482
that is found in parallel with your source
won't affect anything.

53
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:52,482
The resistance sees a voltage <i>v2</i>
equal to zero.

54
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,342
So the current here is
forcibly equal to zero

55
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,762
and your current <i>IS</i>,
is called a short-circuit current

56
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,532
and it's the current
that we will take a direct reading from here.

57
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:04,372
But unfortunately here
it's a short-circuit current

58
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,500
that feeds into the mass

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,820
and that we've never been able to read
in voltage because the voltage was nil.

60
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,562
So we can't short-circuit a current source

61
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:17,872
having given that the current reading
passes by its voltage conversion.

62
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,752
Learn this, each time
that we have a current that we want to read,

63
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,342
we transform it into voltage.

64
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:26,402
Unfortunately for the current,
you will have to put an ammeter

65
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:30,402
and therefore cut the line to be able to read
it, or use another effect

66
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,882
which is the effect <i>hall</i>,

67
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:35,882
and this <i>hall</i> effect,
isn't used in tri-phase circuits,

68
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,362
so we always go through the conversion
of a current into a voltage

69
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,582
because we can take the voltage
in an amplifier

70
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:46,582
and make it bigger or smaller and
keep a linear relationship.

71
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,322
So, what should we do?

72
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,734
We should do the following.

73
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:56,395
We need to take advantage of the fact
that an amplifier has a mass...

74
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,539
the plus connected to the mass
corresponds to an amp

75
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,419
that creates virtual mass.

76
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:07,593
The real mass of 0V is copied by the amp

77
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:09,623
and placed on this node here.

78
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,549
A potential equal to zero is created
on the node <i>A</i>,

79
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,360
which tells you that the difference in voltage
between here and here

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,290
is equal to zero by the fact that
the amp has an infinite gain.

81
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,299
And there you go, your current
source, in terms of voltage

82
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,029
has been short-circuited.

83
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,629
The voltage here is nil.

84
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:32,096
You've got voltage <i>V</i> equal to zero.

85
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:37,535
So, your short-circuit current that
was shown before,

86
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:39,195
is the current <i>iS</i>.

87
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,715
The current source sees
the short-circuit current

88
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,425
so the current continues on its path

89
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,405
and can pass through
the negative feedback resistance.

90
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:51,945
And your voltage <i>v2</i>,
that is between this node and the mass,

91
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,955
is also found between this node here and
the virtual mass

92
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:56,625
because it's got the same potential.

93
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,015
So, we've got <i>v2</i> that's here.

94
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,736
You're going to tell me that it's obvious.

95
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,926
Yes, but it's interesting when it happens.

96
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:09,025
You take a current source that isn't
ideal like this,

97
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:12,235
which has a parallel resistance <i>RS</i>

98
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:14,785
and this resistance,
we don't know its value

99
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:18,955
and it can fluctuate with a phenomenon
linked to the temperature, with age,

100
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:22,675
or any other type of physical phenomenon.

101
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:26,385
And yes, it will always be short-circuited
by the virtual mass,

102
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:31,905
0V here, 0V there, therefore a potential
difference <i>V</i> equal to zero.

103
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,465
So the parasite current passing
through your resistance,

104
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:38,435
this current <i>I</i> is equal to zero.

105
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:42,435
So you've got your current <i>IS - 0</i>
continuing on its path,

106
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:43,695
it remains <i>IS</i>.

107
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:48,935
This parasite resistance therefore has no
more effect on the negative feedback amplifier

108
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,175
having a virtual mass

109
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:55,175
because the voltage <i>v2</i> always remains here

110
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:59,175
and the current <i>IS</i> passes through
the <i>R</i> and will give you a relationship

111
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:02,565
where <i>v2 = -RiS</i>.

112
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:06,408
There are lots of applications for this
type of circuit

113
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,958
and I'd like to show you some of them,

114
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:15,468
how we have captors that convert
physical variables

115
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:16,618
into current.

116
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:21,507
And this current here, we'd like to be
able to read it and convert it into a voltage.

117
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:26,647
And here's an example of an application
in which,

118
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,207
we'd like to be able to use a set-up

119
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,337
like this one.

120
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,548
I suggest that you go into a laboratory

121
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:34,988
if you have the possibility

122
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:38,988
and to make a current-voltage conversion

123
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:42,558
and to take a diode,
an infrared diode,

124
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:47,618
that converts infrared fluxes,
of infrared light,

125
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,698
that arrive at a junction

126
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:54,678
with a proportional current
at the light intensity that arrives here.

127
00:06:54,809 --> 00:07:00,039
You can create a light flux via an emitting diode.

128
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,060
You can get diodes that emit in the
infrared spectrum.

129
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:07,765
So, I suggest that you take an
emitting diode,

130
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:11,765
a receptive diode and apply a current.

131
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,977
Here, we've applied a continuous current.

132
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,010
This current is equal to the power voltage,

133
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,540
therefore it's 5V,

134
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,780
minus the voltage drop at the terminals
of this diode here

135
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,500
that you will have chosen from the market.

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,340
Generally, it's around 1,2-1,3V.

137
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,920
I've put a resistance of 41Ω
to generate a certain current <i>I</i>,

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:44,250
such as <i>I = (5 - 1,3)/41Ω</i>,

139
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,950
that will give you the current here

140
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,100
and this current,
once passed through this diode,

141
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,420
will generate you infrared light

142
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,290
that you can't see
if this diode here is infrared.

143
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,520
And here, you're going to place
a receptive diode.

144
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,140
And often, there's an infrared filter

145
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,650
so it filters certain components outside
of this spectrum here

146
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,020
and a diode of this type converts this
intensity into current.

147
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,020
I'd like to read this current here
in a resistance.

148
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,920
And I've put two, quite big resistances
of 1MΩ,

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,770
and this resistance here will transform
a voltage <i>v2 = IS x R</i>,

150
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,220
that we saw before.

151
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,010
So, it's this relationship
of current-voltage conversion

152
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,350
but the diode that you've added here,

153
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,970
will become polarised
with a voltage <i>V</i> that is equal to zero,

154
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,470
it being given that this zero and
this zero are the same,

154
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,130
so your diode is completely short-circuited

155
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,820
even if the resistance is in parallel,

156
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,430
so the source resistance that is in
parallel with it

157
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,470
guarantees the integrity of the current

158
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,610
that exits the diode,

159
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,030
it being given that it's a very weak current

160
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,740
and that we can't tolerate a current leakage

161
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,380
that passed through any parallel resistance.

162
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,170
You're going to ask what this capacitor is for.

163
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:06,288
If you are in a laboratory and you
want to filter

164
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,968
a certain range of frequencies, because
don't forget

165
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:12,228
that this diode will maybe also receive lamps

166
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:15,768
that are lit around you
or someone passing through.

167
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,108
And yes, with a resistance like this,

168
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,488
I try to create a filter of around 1kHz

169
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:23,728
with the <i>R</i> and the <i>C</i> that are here
to make a low-pass filter

170
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:27,728
so that some parasite components
are filtered out

171
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:31,728
by this negative feedback
that has a complex impedance

172
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:35,728
and that creates a low-pass filter
with an integrating amplifier

173
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:41,718
with a gain or resistance of 1MΩ
in parallel with the resistance <i>C</i>.

174
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:45,718
We call this type of circuit transresistance

175
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,408
because it converts current and voltage.

176
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:51,038
Remember this term, it will be used again.

177
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:54,558
This type of circuit is used in a variety
of applications.

178
00:09:56,293 --> 00:10:01,373
So we're going to look at what happens with
an emission of infrared light

179
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:03,873
with this emitting diode

180
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:07,173
and another receptor of the same light

181
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,303
and later on, we'll try putting
an obstacle in the way.

182
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,264
And here is that obstacle, that
is simply a hand

183
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:16,184
that will reflect the light onto the diode.

184
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:18,824
Watch how the hand
movement affects the oscilloscope.

185
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,034
It's an object detector that is used

186
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,774
in industrial applications.

187
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:26,064
Watch the line where, every time the hand
gets closer

188
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:28,824
and the light intensity increases,

189
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,744
we can see the line going up and down.

190
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:37,692
We've just completed a whole series of
amplifier applications

191
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:41,692
where we've been interested in the relationship
between input and output voltage

192
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,492
multiplied by a certain constant.

193
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,792
So we've done the voltage difference multiplied
by a gain.

194
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,152
We've covered a
current multiplied by a resistance

195
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,702
with the transresistance.

196
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:54,702
And we've already looked at applications
that make use of filters.

197
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,662
And here, I'm going to give a very simple example

198
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:00,572
on how we make a filter application

199
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,592
with an operational amplifier.

200
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:07,775
Here's a plan of a negative feedback op-amp

201
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:09,985
where instead of putting in a simple resistance,

202
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,075
I've put in a resistance and a capacitor.

203
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,910
And here too, I've
put in a resistance and a capacitor.

204
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:20,891
So I've got a complex impedance, that
I've coloured blue.

205
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,733
So, if you take this

206
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:30,206
and you call this impedance <i>Z2</i>,
that is complex,

207
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,866
you'll find it here.

208
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,779
And I've noted that it's the placement in
parallel of <i>R2</i> with <i>C2</i>.

209
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:42,703
Now take the series <i>R1</i> and <i>C1</i>,

210
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,493
and it's this impedance here,

211
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:45,863
and I call it <i>Z1</i>.

212
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:49,536
So here, I've got the impedance <i>Z1</i>.

213
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:54,398
And you've got an amplifier with an
impedance <i>Z2</i>,

214
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,308
an impedance <i>Z1</i>,

215
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:01,348
which constitutes the two impedances
of an inverting amplifier.

216
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:04,468
But this time here, it's not a pure reality

217
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,838
for a resistance on either side.

218
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:10,838
There is a capacitive element that adds
a complex number.

219
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:14,068
And it will help us to create a transfer function

220
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,168
which relays the output voltage
to the input voltage

221
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:21,678
and allows us to, once traced onto
the Bode diagram here,

222
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:25,678
to see that there's a frequency range that
could be affected

223
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,118
by the values of these two impedances.

224
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,200
We've already seen,

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,560
if we look at a capacitor that comes between
the positive and negative terminals,

226
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,860
and we've spoken about the integrating effect,

227
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,570
and we've shown that this can
become a low-pass filter,

228
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,700
and we've seen that if we put a series
resistance here

229
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,180
as input impedance of this amp,

230
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,790
we create a derivative effect

231
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,040
and we've seen that this capacitor here
allows

232
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,200
the making of a kind of high-pass filter

233
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
if we also add a resistance <i>R1</i> in series with it.

234
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:04,871
So this time here, we've cumulated both effects.

235
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:08,306
We've got an effect
that cuts out high frequencies,

236
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,236
we've got an effect that cuts out low frequencies,

237
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:15,236
and we've put the two impedances on either side
of an inverting amplifier

238
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,976
that will allow us to make a frequency,

239
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,696
or to let past a frequency bandwidth.

240
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,446
To broach this type of exercise,
or this way of doing things,

241
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,579
we call it a filter because we're going
to only allow one frequency to pass

242
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,099
that will be multiplied by a gain.

243
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,729
And for certain frequencies,
we'll dampen the signal,

244
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,599
the high frequencies
and the same for the low frequencies.

245
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,319
And it's the impedances <i>Z2</i> and <i>Z1</i>
that will do this.

246
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,007
So, we're going to start by
writing down the impedance <i>Z1</i>.

247
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:45,553
The impedance <i>Z1</i>, is placed in series with
the resistance <i>R1</i> and a capacitor <i>C1</i>.

248
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:48,828
So, we just have to write down
the complex impedance
of each of these.

249
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,828
The impedance of a resistance is a pure
real number, it's <i>R1</i>.

250
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:57,016
The impedance of a capacitor is <i>1/jωC1</i>.

251
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,678
So, I've placed in series <i>R1 + 1/jωC1</i>

252
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,538
that will give me the value of <i>Z1</i>.

253
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,002
I just have to develop it to see it
in a different way.

254
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:10,191
On the other side, I've placed a resistance <i>R2</i>

255
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:14,191
in parallel with a complex impedance,
<i>1/jωC2</i>.

256
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,631
They are in parallel.

257
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,201
So I write down the same thing.

258
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:22,481
I write <i>1/Z2</i>,
that allows me to write <i>jωC2 + 1/R2</i>.

259
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,991
I develop it and inverse it to find <i>Z2</i>.

260
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,940
And I find an impedance <i>Z2</i>
which is equal to the expression.

261
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,110
So I've got my expression <i>Z2</i> and of <i>Z1</i>

262
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,720
and my amplifier that's got <i>Z2</i> here and <i>Z1</i> here,

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:50,098
there's a gain <i>H(jω)</i> that is equal to <i>-Z2/Z1</i>

264
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,048
and that's what I write down here.

265
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:55,028
So, I write down the impedance to the numerator,
that's in blue,

266
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,758
by the impedance that is at the denominator

267
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,678
divided by <i>Z1</i> and I develop it.

268
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,438
So I take this expression here and
this expression here

269
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:04,608
and I develop them.

270
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,518
And here, to get a canonical form...

271
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:13,746
The canonical form,
is to find the easy expressions

272
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,236
to transform into a Bode diagram.

273
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:20,659
I see <i>R2/R1</i>
is a known canonical form.

274
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,064
It's a constant.

275
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:26,016
I see <i>jωR1/C1</i>.

276
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,700
And I see <i>1/1 + jωR1C1</i>

277
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,834
and <i>1/1 + jωR2C2</i>.

278
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:38,928
To make it easier,
to see this,

279
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:43,258
if you develop the expression <i>Z2/Z1</i>,
you will find:

280
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,842
<i>jωR2C1</i>.

281
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,699
And I've given a little calculation tip,

282
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,999
in multiplying this,
to the numerator and to the denominator,

283
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:56,999
by <i>R1</i> and I've divided by <i>R1</i>.

284
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,489
So I don't modify the expression

285
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:04,529
but this will allow me to write down
<i>R2/R1</i>, which I find here,

286
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,419
and <i>jωR1C1</i> that I find here.

287
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:12,312
So it allows me to find simple expressions
and here they are.

288
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:18,134
Here, once I've subdivided this into difference
canonical forms

289
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:23,054
and I've simplified it
to see the forms that we know,

290
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,554
a gain <i>R2/R1</i>,

291
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:30,484
a low-pass filter <i>1/(1 + j(ω/ω2))</i>,

292
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:34,724
a second low-pass filter
<i>1/(1 + j(ω/ω1))</i>

293
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:39,354
and a derivative function <i>j(ω/ω1)</i>.

294
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:42,354
by replacing <i>ω1</i> with <i>1/R1C1</i>

295
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:46,354
and <i>ω2</i> with <i>1/R2C2</i>,
we come to what is here.

296
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:52,109
So this will give us
different canonical functions

297
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,889
that we'll transfer into a Bode diagram.

298
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,259
We've got a function

299
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,620
a second function,

300
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,544
a third function

301
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:04,922
and a fourth function

302
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:07,932
if we look at <i>1/(1 + j(ω/ω1))</i>

303
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,912
and we've got four functions that we
need to trace into

304
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:14,912
a Bode diagram
to see the frequency characteristic

305
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:20,742
of this transfer function
of an amplifier with an impedance <i>Z2</i> and <i>Z1</i>

306
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:23,822
added around the
amplifier which is in the centre.

307
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:30,452
The global transfer
function, which I've coloured in

308
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:36,032
to distinguish the functions <i>1, 2, 3, 4</i>
that I mentioned earlier on.

309
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,221
So, when we want to take a constant <i>R2/R1</i>,

310
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,431
knowing that in a Bode diagram,

311
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:48,051
the asymptotes of the transfer function are
brought over here.

312
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,986
<i>R2/R1</i>, it's a constant.

313
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:56,413
<i>20log(R2/R1)</i> allows us to put it into decibels

314
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:59,533
that corresponds to a right that is
independent to the variation

315
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:00,553
in frequency.

316
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:02,713
So here, I've brought back the pulsations.

317
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:07,764
So remember, <i>ω = 2πf</i>,
<i>f</i> being the frequency.

318
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:11,998
If I look at <i>j(ω/ω1)</i>,

319
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:17,178
<i>1/(1 + j(ω/ω1))</i>, <i>1/(1 + j(ω/ω2))</i>,

320
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:21,828
I recall that <i>ω1</i> and <i>ω2</i> are known,
it depends on the values <i>R</i> and the <i>C</i>

321
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:23,718
that we've used.

322
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:30,262
I bring back <i>ω1</i> and <i>ω2</i>
and I start taking <i>j(ω/ω1)</i>

323
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:34,792
and I trace the transfer function module

324
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,302
that is a right
of a slope equal to +20dB/decade

325
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:40,242
that passes through <i>ω1</i>

326
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,032
that corresponds to the Bode diagram of this.

327
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,242
These two functions are the same.

328
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:48,249
It corresponds to a low-pass filter.

329
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:54,307
One fixed on a pulsation <i>ω1</i>,
the other on a pulsation <i>ω2</i>.

330
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:58,957
So one of them will give an asymptotic diagram

331
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:03,107
which has 0dB up to <i>ω1</i>

332
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:08,057
and will give a slope of -20dB/decade
starting from <i>ω1</i>.

333
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:12,767
So, I've got attenuation, I lose a facture of 10

334
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,357
each time that I go up a multiple of 10 over the
<i>ω</i>, over the pulsations.

335
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:22,337
So I lose 20 decibels each time
I multiply the pulsation by 10.

336
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:27,037
The same for the green function, but it's
a low-pass filter

337
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:31,947
where <i>ω2</i> is much higher than <i>ω1</i>
in the example that I've chosen here

338
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,627
and we find ourselves with this.

339
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:36,595
So, we've learned that when we've got
a Bode diagram

340
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:41,665
and we want to make the diagram of
the whole of this amplifier,

341
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:44,455
given that we're working to a logarithmic scale,

342
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,705
it suffices to add these curves.

343
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:50,441
So I've got a constant that is here, that
I've maintained.

344
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:56,262
I've got +20dB/decade from this red curve

345
00:19:56,262 --> 00:20:04,552
and -20dB/decade from the blue one, corresponding
to this, they'll cancel each other out.

346
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:08,575
So I've got +20dB, -20dB,
that is cancelled out.

347
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,045
This amount here is always equal to
this one here, etc., etc.

348
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,065
So it will give me a plateau

349
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:19,395
but just before <i>ω1</i>,
I've got a slope equal to +20dB/decade

350
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,795
therefore I see it here.

351
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:26,255
Up until <i>ω1</i>, I'm going to see this part
that appears here,

352
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:31,165
offset from the constant part
that corresponds to <i>R2/R1</i>,

353
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:34,755
for sure by 20log of this value to arrive
in decibels.

354
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,933
Now, if we carry on, we get to around <i>ω2</i>.

355
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:43,213
Around <i>ω2</i>, for sure, these slopes of
+20dB, -20dB are cancelled out,

356
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:44,883
which is what gives me this plateau.

357
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:50,373
But from this point here,
we reduce again -20dB/decade

358
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:54,863
from this amount,
which will give us this slope here.

359
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,981
And we see this type of filter
that we can call a band-pass filter

360
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,191
because it allows pulsations to go through.

361
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:05,761
For sure, we've got a true curve that
corresponds to three decibels

362
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:09,061
and three decibels below the asymptotic value

363
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,471
and we see this true curve that corresponds
to what we would have seen

364
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,321
if we had measured here,
everything displaced

365
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:18,341
and multiplied by a gain é<i>R2/R1</i>.

366
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:22,341
And we see that we've got the low frequencies
that will be dampened

367
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:27,071
by this attenuation that appears here and
the high frequencies.

368
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,721
And we've got a frequency bandwidth
that is multiplied

369
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,451
by the gain just between the two.

370
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,161
So, we've created a pass-band filter.

371
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,911
So here you have an extremely
well-known application of an amplifier

372
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:41,911
that corresponds to making amplifiers that
we're interested in

373
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:45,541
to a frequency bandwidth
that we multiply by a gain

374
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,041
and other frequency
bandwidths that we dampen down.

375
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,401
It's called filtering.

376
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:54,081
There's a whole range of courses that cover
the subject of filters

377
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:58,501
and that explains how to develop filters
of all kinds

378
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:02,041
to work on frequencies and to eliminate
certain frequency components

379
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,271
of a given signal.
