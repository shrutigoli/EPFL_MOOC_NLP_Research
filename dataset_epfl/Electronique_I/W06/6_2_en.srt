1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,340
Now, I would like you to
into the laboratory,

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,050
and connect
an operational amplifier

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,400
which produces  a gain
equal to 100,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,170
So, an amplifier producing a gain of 100
connected in this way

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,430
Remember that this
is a closed-loop gain

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,440
<i>A</i> equals  resistance <i>R2</i>

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,440
divided by resistance <i>R1</i>
with a minus sign.

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:33,927
This gain represents the ratio
between voltage <i>v2</i>

9
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:35,877
divided by voltage <i>v1</i>.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,100
If we talk about  a sinusoidal function,
we're referring to a transfer function,

11
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,707
involving complex numbers,

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,220
We can observe that this gain
corresponds to an amplification

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,600
of voltage <i>v2</i> and voltage <i>v1</i>

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,740
through a relationship
based on resistance

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,080
and  resistance in this example,

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,700
is equal to 100.

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,480
What you see here,
is simply a dB Metre

18
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:05,488
which has been connected
to show the ratio<i>v2/v1</i>.

19
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:12,535
If we're given  20 log for <i>R2/R1</i>\
and we know that the gain is equal to 100

20
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:17,195
so it's 20 times log to base,
10 of the value 100

21
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:21,195
that will give us a
magnitude of 40 decibels.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,020
So we are looking at the gain
in the low-pass bandwidth of our amplifier

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
and we can see that it is perfectly
within the magnitude range

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,160
expected from
these two resistances.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,480
Of course, the minor error
that you notice here,

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,980
is due to issues of tolerance
between the resistances in this experiment

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,580
as in lab conditions, we take accurate readings.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,880
Here is the same montage
in the actual experiment

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,880
So our amplifier
has been connected

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
We have  an oscilloscope that shows
the  voltage ratio <i>v2/v1</i>.

31
00:01:54,507 --> 00:02:01,547
and a dB Metre which gives us a reading
of the gain of our amplifier,

32
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,180
plus our function generator
which injects a sinusoidal voltage,

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,540
and we can clearly see that
the voltage is sinusoidal.

34
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,200
So now, we will demonstrate
that by taking the value

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,300
or more accurately
the connected signal <i>v1</i>,

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,940
and we're going to change its frequency.

37
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,398
And when the frequency changes,
you will notice that

38
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:25,028
<i>R2</i> and <i>R1</i>
remain unchanged

39
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,708
we  keep the same gain.

40
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:33,147
When we increase the  <i>v1</i> frequency ,
this will be mirrored by  the <i>v2</i> frequency

41
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:39,737
you'll see on the oscilloscope
that the voltage will <i>v2</i> go down.

42
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:42,327
and will follow the Bode diagram

43
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:45,787
that we saw earlier on and
corresponds to the low-pass filter.

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,140
By keeping the same gain and
by increasing the <i>v1</i>,frequency

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,020
you'll see that <i>v2</i> will go down
and tend towards a value,

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,530
which, were we to carry on,

47
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,708
would become so weak
that it wouldn’t even

48
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,268
be registered on the oscilloscope.

49
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,058
We can see this <i>fT</i> frequency

50
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:08,258
At the input and output,
we have two voltages

51
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,500
which are phase-inverted
in relation to each other

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,960
that's an inverter.

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,580
We're increasing the frequency
of the input voltage.

54
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:18,222
Watch the voltage in blue,
which is the output one

55
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,742
and is disappearing.

56
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,932
as a result of the amplifier's action.

57
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:27,762
and we can see it completely disappear
because of the transfer function

58
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,302
that we have just seen before.

59
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:33,444
Now, let's go back in the other direction
and  look for the -3dB

60
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,644
to find out  the dominant pole.

61
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:39,644
Let's change the frequency
of our input voltage

62
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:43,004
and we'll go up to an attenuation of 3dB.

63
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:46,164
You will see that the output voltage
has reached an attenuation of 3dB,

64
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:49,294
it's the operational amplifier's
natural pulsation

65
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,094
at which the amp has now reached

66
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:54,094
a slope of 20dB/décade.

67
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,540
So this is a  well-known phenomenon
in amplifiers

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,950
which is linked to
its internal structure.

69
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:06,307
Another limitation of the
operational amplifier,

70
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:10,707
is the maximum variation
of the output voltage.

71
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,944
Unfortunately,  to achieve stability

72
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,040
of the operational amplifier,

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,790
we have to add a capacitor
which we find inside,

74
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:24,064
we'll see it in the
microelectronics course,

75
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,464
but it doesn't appear
in the integrated circuit,

76
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,734
because it's integrated
into the microchip.

77
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:32,084
A certain amount of time is required
for this capacitator to charge up,

78
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:36,084
which limits the voltage
change at the output.

79
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,339
So, this is not linked
to an issue of frequency

80
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,339
but rather to the variation in voltage.

81
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,769
When the voltage goes up from
one value to another,

82
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,729
we'll see that it will take this voltage
a certain time

83
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,729
and we're talking about the <i>slew rate</i>
of an operational amplifier.

84
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,680
And here's the explanation of the maximum
variation of the output signal,

85
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,000
that we call the <i>slew rate</i>
of an amplifier.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,220
It's also a value of the output signal
provided  by the manufacturer

87
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:09,609
which is determined by a ratio
of the internal current of our amp,

88
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,219
we can't see it, it's not up to us
to decide its value,

89
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,019
it has been used by the manufacturer 
to polarise the transistors

90
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,789
inside the amplifier,

91
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,029
divided by a capacitor, that
has been added by the manufacturer

92
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:27,149
to compensate for the frequency

93
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,349
of an amp that will be used
in negative feedback.

94
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:33,218
So, even if you don't fully understand
what this here means,

95
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:37,218
Remember that the curve
that we've just looked at

96
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:39,948
on the Bode diagram
corresponds to a low-pass filtre,

97
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:45,328
is achieved like this,
and the low-pass bandwidth is limited

98
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,408
due to an internal capacitor.

99
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:52,051
The <i>slew rate</i> is expressed in
volts per microsecond.

100
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,478
Therefore, it's a time variation.

101
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,478
So we're looking at the
ouput voltage of an amp

102
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,938
and how long it takes
for this voltage to change

103
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,198
from one value to another.

104
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:08,198
So, it's a ratio of a voltage variation
divided by time

105
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:11,498
which we can observe
on a square or triangular signal

106
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,160
and we'll try and analyse it

107
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,440
particularly in relation
to a sinusoidal voltage,

108
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,560
to show that there's a link
whose formulation may seem a little odd

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,500
because it will be expressed in relation
to  frequency

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,600
and yet, it's a variation which is no other 
than a variation in output voltage.

111
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:30,179
We're now going to have a look at the
consequences of the <i>slew rate</i>

112
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:33,759
on a sinusoidal voltage
applied to an operational amplifier.

113
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:36,578
If you take a sinusoidal voltage

114
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:39,028
and apply it to an op-amp

115
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,838
that has a <i>slew rate</i> supplied by
the manufacturer.

116
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,647
So, you've got an amp 
with a <i>slew rate</i>

117
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,387
of a given value

118
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:49,097
and you provoke a negative
feedback in your amp

119
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,947
and you apply this voltage.

120
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:56,922
The voltage that appears at the input

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,500
should be multiplied by a gain or
transformed in a certain way

122
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,560
but it should stay remain linear
with the output voltage,

123
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,322
it's a linear application.

124
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,590
So, the <i>slew rate</i> will have the
following effect.

125
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:13,617
There's a limit
that prevents your amp

126
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:16,867
from registering a sharp
variation in voltage.

127
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:20,227
So there is a limit that is
equal to a given value

128
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:23,317
of a number of volts
over a unity of time

129
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,857
and that these volts
over a unity of time,

130
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,477
that are supplied
by the manufacturer,

131
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:30,757
will react  in such a way that when
the voltage wants to move

132
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,707
or sharply increase,
the amp will resist.

133
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:36,682
So, when looking at
a sinusoidal voltage

134
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,062
and looking for the point at which

135
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:43,102
the sinusoidal voltage does a
<i>dv/dt</i> - the blue - sharp,

136
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,832
we will notice that it's
when it goes through zero.

137
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:45,260
Each time the sinusoidal voltage
goes through zero,
we notice that it's
when it passes through zero.

138
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,442
Each time the sinusoidal voltage
goes through zero,

139
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,722
there's a higher <i>dv/dt</i> ratio.

140
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,722
In other cases, it will continue,
the voltage will continue to rise,

141
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:58,012
until a certain time when
<i>dv/dt</i> is equal to zero.

142
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,748
So, if you take this sinusoidal voltage

143
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,748
and look for the voltage

144
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:09,748
or rather the impact of this <i>slew rate</i>
on the voltage

145
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,628
you just have to derive it
when it goes through zero

146
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:15,198
because it's that's the highest impact
of the <i>slew rate</i>.

147
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:16,538
So, let's derive.

148
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:23,286
<i>Ûsin(ωt)</i> at the instant <i>t</i> equals 0
which will give us <i>ωÛ</i>.

149
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:29,935
So <i>ωÛ</i> corresponds to the
frequency <i>ω = 2πf</i>

150
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,305
and if you write down
this ratio like this,

151
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,715
you get a maximum frequency
limited by this <i>slew rate</i>,

152
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:40,035
which is equal to <i>slew rate</i>,
the given value,

153
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:43,205
divided by <i>2 x π</i> x Û*.

154
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:46,175
So we can clearly see
that in this denominator,

155
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:51,245
we've got the amplitude
of the sinusoidal voltage that we've applied.

156
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:56,608
which means that the more we increase
the input voltage,

157
00:08:56,608 --> 00:09:01,148
the more you limit the utilisation
frequency of your amplifier

158
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,548
and that the voltage 
that you've applied,

159
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,188
that is a sinusoidal voltage,

160
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,868
doesn't have the time to change
at the amp's output,

161
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:11,798
because it's being held
back by the <i>slew rate</i>

162
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:15,388
and that transforms more or less
into something that looks like

163
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,218
a triangular signal.

164
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,952
So, we can't keep the linearity
between the input and the output

165
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:26,083
and the amp or the application
that you've used,

166
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,993
as it is not at all
performing its function.

167
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,143
So we just need to reduce
the peak value

168
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,963
to get back to a sinusoidal voltage

169
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,533
between the input
and the output.

170
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,373
Let's look at a digital example.

171
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,200
Let's assume that you've bought an amp, 
or that you're using an amplifier 

172
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,020

bought on the market,
Let's assume that you've bought an amp, 
or that you're using an amplifier 

173
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020

bought on the market,

174
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,580
which has a voltage, or a <i>slew rate</i>
equal to 2V/μs,

175
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,326
a value supplied
by the manufacturer,

176
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:55,576
and that you're applying a voltage with
a peak value equal to 10V

177
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,496
and you're using this ratio.

178
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:02,291
This ratio will tell you that you
can use your amplifier

179
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:08,881
up to the order of magnitude 31.8kHz
because over this value,

180
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:12,182
you will no longer see a sinusoidal
output voltage,

181
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:14,982
you'll see something that doesn't even
have the time

182
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,302
to get to the higher value.

183
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:21,302
because It's limited by your amp's
internal <i>dv/dt</i>

184
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:27,323
Now, if you simply change the peak value

185
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:30,163
of the voltage that you apply at the input,

186
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,643
and you select 1V instead of 10V,

187
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,483
Let's look at what happens here.

188
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:38,503
You'll see that <i>fmax</i> equals 318kHz.

189
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:44,224
So you've increased the utilisation frequency
of your amplifier

190
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,084
by the power of 10.

191
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,691
There's a fundamental difference 
between a limitation

192
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,991
caused by the <i>slew rate</i> of an amp

193
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:54,811
and the frequency limitation of an amp,

194
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,851
that we had analysed before and 
brought back to

195
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:01,041
the low-pass bandwidth of an amp
We  had spoken about the frequency

196
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:05,481
of <i>fGBW</i> that we also call
the transition frequency.

197
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,201
There is no direct link between
one or the other.

198
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:12,631
One, limit in the variation amplitude, that is
the <i>slew rate</i>,

199
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:17,281
the other one is independent of the amplitude
but it is limiting

200
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,181
the amplifier's frequency.

201
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:24,328
That said, if you are tracing the Bode
diagram of an amplifier

202
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,798
and you apply a sinusoidal voltage,

203
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:30,318
if you don't watch the voltage output

204
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:34,318
and that, by chance, you were applying
a voltage

205
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,358
or a voltage amplitude that 

206
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,518
caused the <i>slew rate</i> to start
reacting on your signal frequency,

207
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,748
you haven't got a sinus at the output,

208
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:45,788
so you won't be able to trace 
a Bode diagram of it

209
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,948
and your amplifier 
isn't performing its role.

210
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:52,948
So, I recommend that you 
always connect an oscilloscope

211
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,328
at the output of your amp

212
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,238
and check that your amplifier

213
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:58,408
has a sinusoidal voltage at the input,

214
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,178
and is transforming it to a sinusoidal voltage

215
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,818
by multiplying it by a certain gain 
or by filtering it,

216
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,678
but always keeping 
this linear relationship

217
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,158
between one and the other,

218
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:12,158
because, if by chance, you have applied a peak
value at the input

219
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:16,298
that causes the amp to be limited 
byits  <i>slew rate</i>,

220
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:19,308
you'll loose your output voltage.

221
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:23,308
So take care that the output
 isn't affected

222
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:26,798
by an operational amplifier's
excessive <i>slew rate</i>.

223
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:31,367
So, at the input of the amp, 
we apply a square wave signal,

224
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,057
that's marked in yellow,

225
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:36,447
and we're going to look to see 
what happens at the output.

226
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,879
We're looking at a positive <i>slew rate</i>

227
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,619
that isn't at all the same thing 
as a negative slope,

228
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,049
that is a negative <i>slew rate</i>.

229
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:48,049
In this respect, manufacturers give us
different values.

230
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:53,062
In this type of behaviour, we see that
there isn't any symmetry

231
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,732
in this structure.

232
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,562
The negative <i>slew rate</i> seems to be
completely different.

233
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,090
And we can also see that there's 
 quite a special reaction happening

234
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,020
due to the fact that our amplifier is
in tracking mode

235
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,320
and later, you'll learn about a limitation

236
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,290
which is called the <i>common-mode range</i>,

237
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,870
It's an unusual phenomenon 
that appears at the input.

238
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:14,295
Now we apply a sinusoidal voltage,

239
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:18,295
which is a tracker, so we expect 
the output to be the same.

240
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:23,571
And we're going to modify the amplitude
of our input voltage

241
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:26,631
and look at the output,
how it is being modified.

242
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:31,531
The blue curve, the sinusoidal voltage,
is no longer a sinusoidal voltage.

243
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:33,531
It's almost a triangular signal.

244
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,761
And this triangular signal 
corresponds to the tangent

245
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:41,761
slope of our sinus 
when going through zero.

246
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:46,061
So the linearity that we'd expect from an
amplifier has gone.

247
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,477
And this limitation is due to the
amp's <i>slew rate</i>,

248
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,537
it's nothing to do with the frequency.

249
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,437
We haven't changed the frequency.

250
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,687
And now we'll see what happens
in the other direction.

251
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,107
We start to reduce the 
amplitude and again,

252
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,527
we get our sinusoidal voltage 
at the output

253
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:04,465
and the amp's linearity 
has been restored.

254
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:07,135
So, if you're looking at a Bode diagram

255
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:11,511
with a system where the amplitude is 
limited by the <i>slew rate</i>,

256
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:14,501
your dB Metre won’t read the correct values.
