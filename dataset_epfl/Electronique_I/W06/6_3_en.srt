1
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:06,278
Another imperfection
 of the amplifier:

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,278
the common-mode
of the amplifier.

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,121
Take a look 
at this schematic here.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,000
I've taken an operational amplifier

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,680
and created a short circuit at the input 
by connecting the plus to the minus.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,250
So I've applied the same voltage 
to the <i>V+</i> and to the <i>V-</i>.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Remember that the voltage <i>v2</i>

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,550
is equal to <i>V+ - V-</i>

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,530
multiplied by the gain
in open loop to the amp,

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,480
When there is a gain in open loop.

11
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:40,015
If <i>V+</i> is equal to à <i>V-</i>,
which is the case here, this...

12
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:45,948
So if we've got <i>V+</i> equal to <i>V-</i>,

13
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:49,948
this should give us
a voltage <i>v2</i> equal to zero.

14
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:54,797
But unfortunately, an amp
wouldn't give you 

15
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:55,807
a voltage <i>v2</i> equal to zero.

16
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,807
You will end up with
a tension that is not  nil.

17
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:02,774
It’s the voltage that 
you've connected

18
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:06,774
on the two terminals, 
the positive and negative ones,

19
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:11,054
because the amplifier shows a gain
which called the common-mode gain,

20
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,344
and this value is  also
supplied by the manufacturer

21
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:16,264
who informs you that your amplifier 
has got a slight gain

22
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:20,594
and that this slight gain will 
follow the ratio <i>v2/v1</i>

23
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:23,434
and has a certain value which is supplied
to you by the manufacturer.

24
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,664
and is equal to the <i>AC</i>
we discussed earlier.

25
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,214
So you'll have <i>v2</i>
which isn't equal to zero,

26
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,584
despite the fact that by default,
we expect that that this will be the case.

27
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:40,267
So it will take <i>v2</i> equal to <i>ΔV</i>
multiplied by the differential gain.

28
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:43,675
This differential gain
is a given gain

29
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,025
and it is the same as the open-loop
gain of your amplifier.

30
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,965
In contrast, the common-mode gain...

31
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,615
Sorry, here I've written <i>V</i>,
but it should be <i>C</i>.

32
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:53,285
In contrast, the common-mode
gain of your amplifier,

33
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:57,285
is a gain that's called <i>AC</i>
and this gain <i>AC</i> will multiply

34
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,335
the difference between <i>V+</i> and <i>V-</i>.

35
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:04,685
And the gain <i>AD<difference /i>, the differential gain,
will multiply this V+ - V-</i>

36
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:08,155
by a gain that corresponds to the open-loop
gain of the amplifier.

37
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:12,218
It is referred to by manufacturers

38
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,438
as the common-mode rejection ratio

39
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:19,878
that is <i>CMRR</i>, which is a ratio
between the differential gain

40
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,618
divided by the common-mode gain.

41
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:29,706
And this gain <i>CMRR</i>, or rather this ratio 
<i>CMRR</i> between <i>AD</i> and <i>AC</i>

42
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,336
is supposed to be a very high value

43
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:37,136
because the differential gain of an amp
is supposed to be extremely high.

44
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,186
Remember, it's supposed to be infinite.

45
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:42,136
And the common-mode gain is supposed
to be very weak.

46
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,716
And obviously, the ratio of something
very big

47
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:47,296
over something that is very weak
is supposed to

48
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:49,806
give us a <i>CMRR</i> that is very, very high.

49
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:53,506
So, it's better to have an amplifier
with a very high <i>CMRR</i>,

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:59,336
so it is capable of 
rejecting the common-mode,

51
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:03,906
and therefore not respond in such ways
that if you set up your amplifier and

52
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:08,796
it receives external parasites

53
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:11,356
on the positive and negative terminals

54
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:15,226
and that these parasites
are the same as on the <i>+</i> and the <i>-</i>,

55
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:18,596
we wouldn't like to see
the differential mode affected

56
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,026
by these parasites

57
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:23,176
and would prefer that the differential gain
dominated

58
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,396
over this common-mode gain.

59
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:28,456
So what we're saying is that
 when we have an amplifier

60
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:32,236
and we have the same external parasites
arriving onto the <i>+</i> and the <i>-</i>,

61
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:35,306
these parasites will have an effect

62
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:38,926
and it's the <i>CMRR</i>
that allows us to detect

63
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:42,786
the quantity of parasites
that will remain and continue to effect

64
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,786
the output of our amplifier.

65
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:52,100
Quite briefly, we're going to look at
a real op-amp

66
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
in terms of input and output impedance.

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,450
We've always said that 
there isn't any current

68
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,450
entering the amplifier 
via the terminals <i>+</i> and <i>-</i>.

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,010
It isn't true.

70
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:08,707
If there hadn't been any impedance at
the input of the amp,

71
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,277
then yes, we would have had a current
equal to zero.

72
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,689
The exact model of an amplifier such as the
one that was presented at the beginning,

73
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,739
didn't have any resistor,

74
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:19,989
Neihter did this one or that one.

75
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,159
It had a controlled voltage source

76
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,189
and an output resistor <i>Rout</i>

77
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,339
and we considered that <i>Rout</i>
was equal to zero,

78
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,499
that it didn't exist.

79
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,769
In reality, a complete operational amplifier

80
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,559
does have an output resistor.

81
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,149
This output resistance is weak.

82
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,639
And when the amp 
is in negative feedback,

83
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,919
it is divided by the 
negative feedback rate,

84
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,399
so it is even weaker that the value 
supplied by the manufacturer

85
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,399
because it will be improved 
by the negative feedback rate.

86
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,399
And the nature of the electronics
that we've used in the interior

87
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,989
to create the input and output

88
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:59,989
could have a certain current 
that would be absorbed.

89
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:02,941
And this absorbed current 
would be presented

90
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:08,231
by a resistance called
i>RinC and <i>RinC</i>.

91
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,721
So both these resistances 
are common-mode resistances.

92
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:15,551
And a differential resistance
between the <i>+</i> and the <i>-</i>

93
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:19,811
which corresponds to the scales
of magnitude of an amplifier

94
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,571
when it is designed 
with bipolar technology.

95
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,901
So, if the transistors used 
are bipolar transistors,

96
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,261
we get this type of magnitude
for the input resistance

97
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,311
and the output impedance,
or the output restance of the amp,

98
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,691
it could be much 
weaker than these 75 Ω

99
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,821
that are shown here.

100
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,361
And all of that depends on
the practical implementation

101
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,201
in the form of microelectronics.

102
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,001
You need to know that when the 
manufacturer sells you an amplifier,

103
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,851
he will supply you with three values

104
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,851
and these three values 
can be modelled in this way

105
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,091
to take into account 
this type of imperfection.

106
00:05:53,833 --> 00:06:00,803
Another source of imperfection 
is called the offset voltage

107
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,943
or the '<i>offset</i> voltage.

108
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:09,738
When we considered the
 output voltage specification

109
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:12,678
in relation to the difference <i>V+ - V-</i>,

110
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:16,268
we got this curve here, 
which was completely confused

111
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:17,768
with this axis here.

112
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,178
So this curve went 
through the origin.

113
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:25,816
However, what we're saying here is:
"No, there's an offset voltage."

114
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:29,788
So, instead of being like this,
this curve follows  the red curve.

115
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:38,623
So it can be offset,
either in this direction,

116
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:41,523
or in that direction,

117
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,893
by the value <i>Vi0</i>,

118
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:48,803
that we call the <i>offset</i> voltage
of the amplifier.

119
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,748
So this voltage is uncertain.

120
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:54,258
It has a Gaussian distribution.

121
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,935
It could be either like this, or like that.

122
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:03,175
In the same batch, fabricated in the
same microchip factory,

123
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,175
there can be amplifiers 
that have positive <i>offset</i> voltages

124
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,245
and negative <i>offset</i> voltages.

125
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:12,255
This is linked to the 
manufacturing process

126
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:14,745
and to what is called
 impendence matching

127
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:19,515
or to what extent the transistors

128
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,855
fabricated inside an amplifier

129
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,265
are compatible and are able to 
compensate for each other

130
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,485
without creating an offset voltage.

131
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,645
Unfortunately, we can only
get rid of this voltage

132
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:34,645
by using quite advanced
electronic techniques

133
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:36,955
and that it's a voltage model.

134
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:39,485
This voltage isn't measured in this way.

135
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:42,575
You can't come and connect a voltmeter
 from one part to another

136
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,365
because it doesn't exist.

137
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,625
It's a model.

138
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:50,435
It's a model to simply show that 
all of the electronic effects

139
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,895
brought to the input can 
show up as a form of voltage

140
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,675
that we call the <i>offset</i> voltage.

141
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,225
And that the manufacturer 
supplies us with a typical value,

142
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:02,775
a minimum and maximum value
with a Gaussain distribution

143
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,535
of this <i>offset</i> voltage.

144
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:10,559
If we want to measure the <i>offset</i> voltage
of an operational amplifier,

145
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,679
it is sufficient to connect it 
in tracking mode.

146
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:16,085
You take an operational amplifier,
and you connect it to tracking mode.

147
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:19,695
So you take the positive input,
and connect it to the volume

148
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:22,655
and you connect a voltmeter at the output,

149
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,745
as I am doing here.

150
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:28,166
I've taken a 741 amplifier.

151
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,386
I've connected it in tracking mode.

152
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:35,163
So it's an amp that will yield 
a very high open-loop gain.

153
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,626
So this voltage here,
which should be at zero,

154
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,126
when we've physically 
connected it to zero,

155
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,656
this <i>offset</i> voltage,
should either be here,

156
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,572
or on the other side.

157
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,313
Put simply, it appears 
modelled at the input

158
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:57,543
and this <i>offset</i> voltage,
is the offset

159
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:02,083
between this node here, 
copied to this node here,

160
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,173
and added and 
brought to the output

161
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:09,173
and when I measure the output voltage
 <i>v2</i> in relation to the volume,

162
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,573
that's what my voltmeter is showing now,

163
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:17,563
and here, I see that I've got an order
of magnitude of 1mV <i>offset</i>

164
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:20,363
of this amplifier
that I am now measuring.

165
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,993
Of course, if I change circuits 
and connect a different one,

166
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:24,300
It'll have a different <i>offset</i> voltage.
Of course, if I change circuits 
and connect a different one,

167
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,493
It'll have a different <i>offset</i> voltage.

168
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,913
Manufacturers provide two terminals.

169
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,951
And physically, on these two terminals,

170
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,401
we can connect an external potentiometer

171
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:36,098
and we can set the potentiometer
 to reduce this voltage.

172
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:40,408
But you need to know that this voltage
 <i>drifts</i>, and changes.

173
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:43,787
We can't hold it 
at a given value

174
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,497
because it changes in relation to 
different parameters,

175
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,377
especially temperature.

176
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:51,217
So we can't compensate for, 
or hold the <i>offset</i>

177
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,617
You need to always 
work on the amplifier

178
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,137
to wipe out the voltage <i>offset</i>.

179
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,409
So, to finish with the imperfections
of an operational amplifier,

180
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,729
we're going to look at the fact
that the current

181
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,479
passing through the positive
and negative terminals

182
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,249
isn't exactly equal to zero.

183
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:09,839
In reality, a current does exist.

184
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,789
It depends on the specifications
of the internal transistors

185
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:13,799
which are used.

186
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,340
Sometimes, this current can 
go up to some nanoamps 

187
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,359
or there can be 
weak leakages in the current.
Sometimes, this current can 
go up to some nanoamps 

188
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:20,140
or there can be 
weak leakages in the current.

189
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,040
So, the manufacturers 
of these operational amplifiers

190
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,040
will always talk about two
 imperfection parameters.

191
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:33,497
They'll provide the value of current <i>IB+</i>
and of current <i>IB-</i>.

192
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:37,356
They present it as an average 
polarisation current.

193
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:42,187
So, they'll take the sum of both of them
and divide it by two

194
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,457
and that gives us an average 
value for the current

195
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,177
passing through one or the other.

196
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:50,357
You should remember that, 
as for the voltage <i>offset</i>,

197
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,497
this current always differs 
from one and the other.

198
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,987
We can't guarantee that the current
is equal to that,

199
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,277
that one equals the other.

200
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:59,067
However, an average value is given
by the manufacturer.

201
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:03,357
And to finish off, they also give 
a type of distribution statistic too,

202
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,147
of the difference between the two,

203
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:09,147
that we call the current <i>offset</i>.

204
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:12,077
So, it's the difference between this current
minus this current.

205
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:14,177
You also need to know that for this current,

206
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,767
we can't know if it's input or output.

207
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,587
It can go in both directions.

208
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:23,134
We have now seen the imperfections
of an amplifier

209
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:25,865
It seems to be that

210
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:31,955
that as long as the amplifier is performing
its function within a circuit,

211
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,555
one only has to take 
 the amp and use it

212
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:38,795
while imagining that its imperfections
are true to the ideal characteristics of an amp.

213
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,666
Unfortunately, in the real world,

214
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,786
when we take an operational amplifier

215
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,816
and we want to use it at very high frequencies,

216
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:50,586
we are very quickly confronted
to the fact that finding an amplifier

217
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,586
with a very high frequency, 
will result in a very weak gain.

218
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:55,869
And vice versa.

219
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:57,379
The same for the <i>slew rate</i>.

220
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,379
If you choose an amplifier
with very low consumption

221
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,259
you need to know that the <i>slew rate</i>

222
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,749
will also be very high.

223
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:12,499
And the more energy an amplifier is wasting

224
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,429
the more the <i>slew rate</i> will improve.

225
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:19,589
and your amplifier will be able to cope
with higher and higher

226
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,179
output variations.

227
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,609
and so on, and so forth...

228
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,659
All of these imperfections are
related to one another

229
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,799
and are linked to the technical
implementation within the amplifier.

230
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,300
And unfortunately,
there isn't one existing amplifier 

231
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,259
presenting all these characteristics

232
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,289
There are some advantages 
and disadvantages,
presenting all these characteristics

233
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:38,560
depending on what it's being used for.
presenting all these characteristics

234
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,939
depending on what it's being used for.

235
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:44,789
So, this chapter on the 
imperfections of an amplifier

236
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,729
is one of the most important ones

237
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:51,179
because it's based 
on these values,

238
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,419
that we can choose 
the correct amplifier for the right application.
