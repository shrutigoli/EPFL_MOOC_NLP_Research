1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
that you've got at the input.

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,596
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:08,876
Today, let's look at some of 
imperfections of the operational amplifier.

4
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:12,753
Up until now, we have considered
 the operational amplifier

5
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,853
to be an electronic component 
and we've said that it was perfect,

6
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:18,163
meaning that it has infinite gain,

7
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:22,803
that is is capable of a voltage that,
at the output can be 

8
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,943
as much as that of the power supply,

9
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:29,913
which has the same input voltage 
on both the positive and negative terminals

10
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:33,213
and which takes no current at all 
from the positive and negative terminals.

11
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:37,592
Yet, we will realise that
this isn't exactly the case

12
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:41,682
In this chapter, we're going to look
at some of the imperfections,

13
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:45,682
namely of the actual components
which can be found on the market.

14
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,907
You'll see that there are components,

15
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:50,257
and when choosing 
an operational amplifier,

16
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:53,607
we make a choice 
based on its imperfections.

17
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:57,935
And its not possible to find an amplifier
 which has the best characteristics

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,235
in all of its functions,

19
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:02,995
for example the highest gain coupled with

20
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:04,475
 the widest possible bandwidth.

21
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:08,536
So, in this chapter we will examine
of all of the following points in turn:

22
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,549
In order to look at the different limitations
of an operational amplifier,

23
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,919
we will look at them one by one.

24
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,107
Let's start by looking at

25
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:21,537
the finite voltage gain 
of an open loop op-amp.

26
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,854
So you will realise that 

27
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:27,374
the voltage gain of 
an operational amplifier isn't infinite.

28
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,966
First, what is infinite voltage gain?

29
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:31,496
What is the value which we consider

30
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:33,706
to be high enough for it 
to be referred to as infinite?

31
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,056
Same issue for frequency.

32
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:41,296
We will see that frequency
 and gain are linked

33
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:45,056
and that unfortunately, 
the op-amp can't follow

34
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,116
just any odd input signal

35
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:51,116
but will need to have a dominant pole
that this dominant pole will lead us 

36
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:54,306
to lower the frequency
 in proportion to the gain,

37
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:59,326
or rather to reduce the gain 
as the frequency rises.

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Similarly, we will look at 
another imperfection.

39
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,041
We will see that the output voltage
 of an operation amplifier

40
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,481
 has a value and that this value, 

41
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:17,551
the higher the output voltage is,

42
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,161
the higher the risk of a side effect,

43
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,681
resulting in a linear output voltage.

44
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,791
We're also going to talk 
 about <i>slew rate</i>.

45
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,991
This is the speed at which 
 the output voltage will switch.

46
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,808
Also, we'll see that 
 there is a common mode.

47
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,928
The common mode means 
 that up until today,

48
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:38,488
amps have had a positive 
 and a negative terminal,

49
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:41,628
and every time we have spoken
 about a differential gain,

50
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:46,098
it has meant that the <i>V+</i> minus <i>V-</i>,
the voltage at the positive terminal

51
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,098
and the voltage on the negative terminal
have been multiplied by a differential gain.

52
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:54,095
So if you input the same voltage, 
 you are bound to find an output voltage

53
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,745
that equals zero.

54
00:02:55,761 --> 00:03:00,961
So if <i>V+</i> is equal to <i>V-</i>, it goes without saying 
 that <i>V+</i> minus <i>V-</i> equals zero,

55
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,661
so the output voltage has no gain.

56
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,241
However, unfortunately, 
there will be a gain

57
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:09,911
which we call a common mode gain,
This means that even if you have the same signal

58
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,851
on the positive and negative terminals,
they will be short circuited.

59
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,301
You'll see later on that 
there will be a gain

60
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:18,221
and that this gain will multiply 
the same voltage

61
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,011
and send back the same component 
multiplied by a gain

62
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,841
which  we call common mode gain.

63
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:28,992
There will also be an imperfection 
linked to a difference in continuous voltage

64
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,262
between the <i>V+</i> and the <i>V-</i>.

65
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:35,262
which we will refer to as 
 the <i>offset</i> voltage.

66
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,732
This is the same for input impedance.

67
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:40,612
We had stated that there wasn't 
any current passing through the amp,

68
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:43,362
on the positive and negative terminals,

69
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:47,082
We'll see that it depends on
how the manufacturing of the electronics inside,

70
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:50,292
what type of transistor has been used

71
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,362
and that we are likely to have 
behind the positive and negative terminals,

72
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:53,972
some form of current.
and that we are likely to have 
behind the positive and negative terminals,

73
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:54,340
This current is likely 
to be very weak but it's there,
and that we are likely to have 
behind the positive and negative terminals,

74
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,972
This current is likely 
to be very weak but it's there,

75
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,632
and it isn't the same 
on the positive terminal

76
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:01,982
as on the negative terminal,

77
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,262
which will lead us to talk about 
polarisation of current

78
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:06,802
and <i>offset</i> current.

79
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,670
The first imperfection 
of an operational amplifier

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,890
is the finite gain of an amp.

81
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,092
So, up until now, we had considered


82
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,082
that an amplifier's gain <i>Av</i> was infinite.

83
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:21,362
So each time, we've said 
that the gain was equal to infinity.

84
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:24,452
And each time we've looked 
at the voltage difference

85
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,992
between the positive 
and negative terminals

86
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:31,992
compared to the output voltage, 
we've  divided the voltage <i>v2</i> by infinity

87
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,062
and we've said that <i>Δv0</i> is equal to 0.

88
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:37,779
So what happens if this doesn't equal 0

89
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,769
because there is a finite gain?

90
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,479
It's a given value 
that depends on the amplifier.

91
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:47,943
So if you take the voltage of the node <i>A</i>,
this voltage that appears here,

92
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:51,353
we've always said that 
this voltage was equal to this one

93
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:54,203
by the fact that <i>Δv0</i> is equal to 0.

94
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,923
But now, we have to say that 
this is not the case.

95
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:01,573
The voltage <i>v1</i> minus <i>Δv0</i>
is the voltage that we'll see

96
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,553
on the node <i>A</i>.

97
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:08,362
So we will write the node <i>vA</i>
as being the voltage <i>v1</i>,

98
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:11,722
and this very <i>Δv0</i> as the difference
that we've just discovered

99
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:16,002
which is due to the fact that
 the voltage will be divided by a given value,

100
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,252
that this value will be 
given to us by the manufacturer,

101
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,372
and that we will call it i>Av.

102
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:25,282
So this <i>vA</i>, it will be 
<i>v1</i>\ minus a certain value of <i>v2</i> over <i>Av</i>.

103
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:29,028
And we'll redo the same calculation each time.

104
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,128
So we will say that 
there's a voltage which appears here,

105
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:36,528
a voltage that we will  call <i>vA</i>.

106
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:40,946
And we're going to see a voltage 
that appears on that side

107
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:44,436
and that voltage there, 
will be the voltage <i>vA</i>

108
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:47,726
minus the output voltage <i>v2</i>.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,040
And by writing these two relationships,
<i>vA/R1</i> this gives us the current

110
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,780
that passes through this branch,

111
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,380
is equal to <i>vA-v2/R2</i>, which is equal to the current
passing through that branch there

112
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,850
Of course, we also have 
the minus sign because the voltage is going 

113
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,110
in the opposite direction,

114
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,230
which explains this minus sign.

115
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,555
And we write down this relationship 
by replacing \i1}vA by its value.

116
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,235
So I replace <i>vA</i>
by what we had written here,

117
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,185
which will allow us to find this relationship.

118
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:18,653
So, here's the relationship

119
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:22,653
of the voltage <i>v2</i> divided by <i>v1</i>,

120
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:27,073
namely our amplifier's gain, 
taking into account the gain <i>v1</i>

121
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:31,073
and simplifying the analytic expression 
that we derived earlier on from the fact

122
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:36,123
that the voltage <i>vA</i>
is equal to the sum of <i>Δv0</i>

123
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:39,413
and this voltage <i>v1</i> whilst
respecting the direction of the arrows.

124
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:45,193
So we'll find that the gain <i>v2/v1</i>
is equal to this formula here.

125
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:51,906
If the gain <i>Av</i> had been infinite,

126
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:56,436
this term would disappear and 
we would fall back 

127
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:59,276
on the relationship that we had at the start

128
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:03,276
which is no other than
 the gain <i>1+R2/R1</i>.

129
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:09,355
Now that this gain isn't infinite,
now that we've got a finite value,

130
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:12,685
if we need to calculate <i>v2/v1</i>,
we must look at

131
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:15,825
what the manufacturer has provided us with,
which is the value <i>Av</i>

132
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,875
and put it into this expression here.

133
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,875
And here, we've got 
an exact expression of gain of <i>v2/v1</i>.

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,025
And this is one
of the amplifier's limitations

135
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,035
and when there is even 
a small gain

136
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,375
with the amplifier, 
we must take it into account

137
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:33,925
This will give us the a relationship as follows
 <i>v2/v1</i>, which isn't merely proportional

138
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:37,325
to the external resistors 
that we added ourselves.

139
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:41,523
Here is a second imperfection of the amplifier:

140
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:45,013
When we analysed 
the operational amplifier,

141
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:47,573
we never mentionned the frequency.

142
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,495
And if I show you this Bode diagram

143
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,815
of an operational amplifier,
I'm telling you

144
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:56,595
that the gain that we looked at earlier,

145
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:59,085
the amplifier's open loop gain

146
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,565
that we called <i>Av</i>,

147
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:06,805
and yes, this gain here is valid in a
limited frequency bandwidth

148
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:11,785
and this limited frequency bandwidth 
is given by a pass-band bandwidth

149
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:18,025
presented by a dominant pole
and the Bode diagram

150
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:22,535
of an operational amplifier
is a low-pass function,

151
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:27,275
meaning that we've got a constant gain 
in the low-pass bandwidth

152
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:31,565
up to the dominant pole 
that we call <i>fb</i>.

153
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:35,567
And here, at this frequency 
we've got an attenuation of 3dB.

154
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:41,269
And there's a frequency that 
we call the transition frequency.

155
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,050
And this transition frequency 
is an important value

156
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,120
in an amplifier,

157
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,340
and that all manufacturers, 
when providing a value, 

158
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,340
will provide the value of the open-loop gain 

159
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,870
and of the frequency <i>fT</i> 

160
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,227
called the transition frequency 
And why refer to it as <i>fT</i>?

161
00:08:56,227 --> 00:09:00,967
It's the appropriate frequency
when you apply

162
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:05,397
a signal at the input that 
has a frequency <i>fT</i>,

163
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:09,537
the voltage that you'll get 
at the amplifier's output

164
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:11,757
is exactly the same as the voltage

165
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:14,777
So you have a follower with your amp

166
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:18,137
even if the amp isn't in negative feedback.

167
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,647
So you'll find,

168
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,047
because of this characteristic

169
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,567
that when you want 
to give it a certain gain

170
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,567
when you change the frequency 
and you get to  frequency equal to <i>fT</i>,

171
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,707
you will see that the output voltage

172
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,237
is equal to the input voltage.

173
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:38,837
So in other words, an amplifier 
has an open-loop gain

174
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,857
only for low frequencies.

175
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:44,177
So here, we put <i>fb</i>, but when you see
the value of <i>fb</i> is

176
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:47,057
in the majority of low power amplifiers,

177
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,457
you'll see that it's only a few hertz.

178
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:53,457
So the open-loop gain 
which is supposed to be extremely high,

179
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,977
even to infinity at first approximation,

180
00:09:55,977 --> 00:10:00,267
is in fact limited in frequency, 
which results in a gain

181
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,197
that we call a DC gain,

182
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:05,307
a gain that is quasi continuous voltage.

183
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,527
And when the frequency starts to rise,

184
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:11,500
independently from
its negative feedback, 

185
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,527
and it will go down to around -20dB/décade
independently from
its negative feedback, 

186
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,500
the amplifier starts to reduce the gain 
and it will go down to around -20dB/décade

187
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,557
the amplifier starts to reduce the gain 

188
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,537
until the point of the transition frequency.

189
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,537
And from here  instead of
amplifying a signal,

190
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,197
your amplifier dampens the voltage.

191
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:30,947
So your output voltage
will be weaker that your input voltage.

192
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:35,113
This is the transfer function

193
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:36,373
of an operational amplifier

194
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,406
As we've just seen,
it is a low-pass filter

195
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,646
that has an open-loop gain 
that we call <i>Av</i>

196
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:49,616
divided by <i>1+jω/ωb</i>
and <i>ωb</i> 
and corresponds to <i>2 π fb</i>

197
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,426
which is the frequency 
of the dominant pole.

198
00:10:53,185 --> 00:11:00,185
If we consider that <i>ω</i> is very high
and the the 1, the actual part

199
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:04,455
added to this imaginary part 
when<i>ω</i> is very high,

200
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,475
we can overlook the 1 or the actual part

201
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,435
to the benefit of this complex part 
which is extremely high,

202
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:15,205
and approximate the transfer function
 as if it's <i>Av</i> 

203
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:19,865
divided by <i>j</i> times <i>ω</i> over the <i>ωb</i>,
which is the dominant pole.

204
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:28,273
The <i>GBW</i>, or <i>Gain Band Width product</i>,

205
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:34,553
corresponds to this pulsation <i>ωT</i>
here, where we've put <i>fT</i>.

206
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:40,023
So this frequency <i>fT</i> corresponds 
to a pulsation that we call <i>ωT</i>,

207
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:45,723
but in practice, we call it <i>ωGBW</i>
and I'll explain why

208
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:50,973
we call it pulsation so that they can be provided 

209
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:53,453
by all manufacturers
of operational amplifiers

210
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:56,523
and provided in the format <i>ωGBW</i>

211
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:59,333
and it's a very important concept

212
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,983
because it's thanks to this pulsation,
and thanks to the value <i>Av</i>,

213
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,423
both of these supplied by the manufacturer,

214
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:10,423
that we can deduct 
which gain will be achieved

215
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:15,093
when we want to generate a feedback loop
and give it an finite gain

216
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:17,673
linked to external resistors.

217
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,920
So these two values will allow us


218
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,790
to define the Bode diagram of our amplifier

219
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,470
once in negative feedback.

220
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,470
So if you take a digital example,

221
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,910
I've shown here that up to around 10Hz,

222
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,060
so a very, very low frequency for<i>fb</i>,
this one here representing the gain,

223
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I have chosen an amplifier 
that shows a fairly high gain of 100 000

224
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,120
so we've got 100dB,

225
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
and which has a transition frequency,

226
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,790
so a frequency of <i>GBW</i> equal to 1 MHz.

227
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,809
So here, the Gain Band Width product 

228
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:59,739
of our amplifier is <i>2π10^6</i>, 
taking into account the different values

229
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,549
that I've given here.

230
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:06,453
Let's return to this characteristic 
and look at the fact

231
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:11,193
that this pulsation <i>ωT</i>
will always be equal to the product

232
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:17,923
of the open-loop gain 
multiplied by the dominant pole

233
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,273
of your operational amplifier

234
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:24,273
that we call the frequency <i>fb</i> 
and therefore a pulsation <i>ωb</i>.

235
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,764
If you look at what's happening 
to this frequency here,

236
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:33,934
or to the pulsation of <i>GBW</i>,
the gain is equal to 1.

237
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:37,204
So we've got 0dB on this axis.

238
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:39,654
The output voltage is equal 
to the input voltage

239
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:42,374
and we're talking about a gain equal to 1

240
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:45,304
because of this specification of the amplifier.

241
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:48,984
So when I replace <i>ω</i> by <i>ωT</i>,

242
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:53,724
I should find a pulsation <i>ωT</i> 
divided here  

243
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,374
by the dominant pole of my amplifier,

244
00:13:55,374 --> 00:14:01,584
and that the open-loop gain
at the numerator 

245
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:05,584
and all this should altogether 
give me a gain equal to 1

246
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,954
because it has become a follower.

247
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,504
So if you develop this you'll find that

248
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:15,244
 <i>ωT</i> is equal to <i>Av</i>,
open-loop gain, multiplied by <i>ωb</i>.

249
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:22,184
So the gain band width product 
is equal to <i>ωGBW</i>,

250
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,374
we can also call it <i>ωT</i>.

251
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:29,052
And if you use this expression,
it's the same as the demonstration,

252
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:32,652
the value provided by the manufacturer,

253
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:36,142
As the manufacturer supplies this value,
you do not require the <i>ωb</i>

254
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,102
because you can work it out for yourself

255
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:42,032
Each time that you will put you amplifier
into negative feedback

256
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:45,192
because you'll find yourself in this range 

257
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:49,542
on the Bode diagram, 
all of which  will give you

258
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:53,542
a product gain times
the Gain Band Width product

259
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,182
is equal to the constant is equal to <i>fT</i>.

260
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,744
So we can write down:

261
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:01,044
for any type of pulsation 
of our operational amplifier,

262
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:06,264
we will achieve a gain 
that is equal to <i>ωT</i> divided by the <i>ω</i>

263
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:09,294
at which we are using our amplifier.

264
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:13,168
And now, here is what will happen 

265
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:14,340
with any kind of amplifier 

266
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,368
that you may use.
with any kind of amplifier 

267
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:16,340
Any amplifier you may purchase
will have an open-loop gain,
that you may use.

268
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,368
Any amplifier you may purchase
will have an open-loop gain,

269
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,561
and a transition frequency.

270
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,381
You're going to put it 
in negative feedback.

271
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,071
When it's in open-loop,
you don't have to add external resistors.

272
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:29,421
Let's imagine that you take your amplifier

273
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:32,661
and turn it into a negative feedback amp

274
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,141
in the following way.

275
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,671
So, you add a resistor here

276
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,936
and a second resistor there

277
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,809
your output will depend
on an input voltage

278
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:48,949
that we call <i>v1</i>,

279
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,739
a voltage output that we call <i>v2</i>

280
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,489
and there's a resistor
here that's called <i>R2</i>

281
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,859
and another one 
that's called <i>R1</i>.

282
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,822
Earlier on, we calculated the expression

283
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:06,032
of the relationship <i>v2</i> over <i>v1</i> taking
into account he amplifier's gain.

284
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,692
And we' ve realised 
that the gain of this amplifier

285
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,972
is nothing more than a transfer function.

286
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,842
So I can replace this transfer function

287
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,332
with its value, the one I've just found here.

288
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,332
By simplfying it and considering 
that for fairly high <i>ω</i>

289
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:24,332
I can overlook the 1 
in favour of the complex number,

290
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,672
and we can choose for any given pulse <i>ω</i>

291
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:32,032
and we'll find that for <i>1/j(ω/ωT)</i>,

292
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,182
when we replace the product 
that we've just found

293
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:40,212
that everytime time, the gain product times
the low-pass bandwidth is equal to <i>ωT</i>,

294
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,142
by replacing this here, 
we are going to find this relationship

295
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,522
that I've highlighted in red.

296
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:49,562
And for any gain

297
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:52,662
that you will realise with your amp 
using the two external resistors

298
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:55,242
that you have added,

299
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:58,412
you can deduct straight away
the low-pass bandwidth

300
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:02,412
which is linked to the limitation 
of the low-pass bandwidth of your amplifier 

301
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:06,412
supplied by the manufacturer
 in the form of <i>fT</i>.

302
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,475
If you know this <i>fT</i>,
you will always write down 

303
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:13,935
this expression when looking
for this <i>f'b</i> value

304
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:17,935
in order to identify the pulsation, 
or the frequency at which

305
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:24,015
your amplifier will show a gain 
and a dominant pole,

306
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:27,465
that the position 
on this asymptomatic diagram

307
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:30,405
will be defined by the 
external gain of your amplifier 

308
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:33,735
that is caused by your two resistors,

309
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,755
and that when you achieve a pulsation

310
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,665
and you will meet the curve of your amp.

311
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,125
So the amp is going to lower your signal

312
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,875
by counts of 20dB/décade

313
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,825
and it will lead you to see this filter function

314
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,685
because of its original specification.

315
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:53,515
Each time you will find 
the value of this <i>f'b</i>

316
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:57,515
or express it as being <i>f'b</i>,
the value which is here,

317
00:17:57,515 --> 00:18:00,735
multiplied by the gain 
that you have just realised

318
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,925
via the external resistors,

319
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,555
and is always equal to a constant,
is equal to <i>fT</i>

320
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:10,585
and which is always equal to <i>Av</i>
multiplied by the <i>fb</i>

321
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,885
of the amplifier 
before the negative feedback.

322
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:15,621
And voilà, 
each time that you come 

323
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:19,621
to use an operational amplifier 

324
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,620
you can deduct yourselves 
the value of the low-pass bandwidth 
and that manufacturer 
has provided you with <i>fT</i>,

325
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,121
you can deduct yourselves 
the value of the low-pass bandwidth 

326
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,161
that will be achieved

327
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,331
when you generate a negative feedback
with a gain of your choice

328
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,731
depending on external elements.

329
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,901
Be aware that this is a constant phenomenom

330
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:36,901
because the product,
the <i>GBW</i> of your amp is constant

331
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:39,361
and always equal to its open-loop gain

332
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,121
multiplied by <i>fb</i>.

333
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:44,022
To summarise what we've just seen,

334
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:48,922
the weaker the closed-loop gain,
the wider the low-pass bandwidth.

335
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,279
If you now look at this expression

336
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,289
this is constant, which is supplied
prior to using your amp,

337
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,599
you can't go beyond <i>fT</i>
and this <i>fT</i> has already been fixed

338
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,789
in the manufacturer's specifications.

339
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,333
So using this information 
you should straight away be in a position

340
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,063
to calculate the gain 
which can be achieved with your amplifier

341
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:14,653
depending on your signal and
on the negative feedback

342
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,513
that you have added.

343
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,184
So we've just seen

344
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:21,274
that an operational amplifier's gain
and its low-pass bandwidth,

345
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:24,564
are firmly linked

346
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,954
and that every time we want
to achieve a high gain,

347
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:31,014
we have to increase 
the low-pass bandwidth along with it

348
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:35,714
because we will always have
the low-pass gain product of an amp

349
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:38,834
equal to a constant pulse

350
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:42,334
which is equal 
to this famous transition frequency,

351
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:46,964
or the frequency that corresponds to 
what we have referred to 

352
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,644
as the <i>GBW</i> or the <i>ω</i> of <i>GBW</i>.

353
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,924
So, each time that we purchase 
an amplifier on the market,

354
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:57,204
or that we choose amplifiers  
that have an increasingly higher gain,

355
00:19:57,204 --> 00:20:01,424
be aware that  
they are weaker in frequency

356
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:05,684
and that when you're looking for  
a wide bandwidth on an operational amplifier,

357
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:09,684
unfortunately, you'll often have a weaker gain.

358
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:12,104
These are compromises  
that you need to be aware of.

359
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,901
and vice versa.
